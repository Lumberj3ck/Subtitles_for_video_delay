00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:30,897
Come on, Drax, dance.

8
00:02:31,262 --> 00:02:32,760
Only idiots dance.

9
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:43,800
I'm a weirdo.

10
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:06,360
I wanna have control.

11
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:12,607
I want a perfect body...

12
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:49,004
Hey! Uh-uh!

13
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:56,962
I told you a million times, you keep your
grubby raccoon hands off my Zune!

14
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:02,109
I told you a million times,
I'm not a damn raccoon.

15
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:24,136
Again?

16
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,834
I love you, Gamora.

17
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,564
So what are you
gonna do about Quill?

18
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,413
Me? Why not you?

19
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,438
I got emotionalistical issues.

20
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:49,755
What am I gonna do?

21
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:51,105
Why are you on the ceiling?

22
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:54,116
I wanted to see if these new
gravity boots worked on a slope.

23
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,428
Here we go.

24
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:17,631
Sorry.

25
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,190
(Cosmo speaking Russian)

26
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:28,215
You must know you will never learn.

27
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,824
You could do better?

28
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:31,871
Dah.

29
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:33,925
*

30
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,657
Telekinesis is cheating!

31
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:55,532
That's a stupid little pebble.

32
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:57,557
I can do that with my dang finger.

33
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,945
You're a bad dog.

34
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,125
Do not say that to me.

35
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:03,875
You are. You're a bad dog.

36
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,931
Take that back. Come on,
that's not cool.

37
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:09,056
Nebula, did you hear?

38
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:12,259
He called me a bad dog and
he refuse to take it back.

39
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:13,954
I don't care, Cosmo.

40
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,587
Is Peter okay?

41
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,243
- I don't know.
- What are you going to do?

42
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:19,268
Me? He's your brother.

43
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:21,876
It doesn't matter, he still
doesn't listen to me.

44
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,829
Yeah, he has been pretty mopey
ever since Gamora died.

45
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,064
She's not dead.

46
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:28,860
She just doesn't remember
anything from the past few years.

47
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,196
Nobody tells me nothing.

48
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:33,446
Mantis, why don't you just touch him?
You know, make him happy.

49
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,540
I am Groot.

50
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:35,345
Gross!

51
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,564
No, not like that.
Touch him with her powers.

52
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,267
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

53
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,292
What about that time you made
me fall in love with my sock?

54
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:45,025
Well, that was funny.

55
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:47,532
I guess it's back to one of us
touching him the other way.

56
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,618
Maybe we should draw straws.

57
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:50,883
No one ever meant that, Drax.

58
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:49,654
What was that?!

59
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:51,162
What the hell?!

60
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:06,662
Where did you go, Squirrel?

61
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:15,820
On the ground!

62
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:17,524
Who is that maniac?

63
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:21,164
Some super-douche with ray gun hands!
I don't freakin' know.

64
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,569
Who threw this thing at me?

65
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,108
Shut up.

66
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,506
Baby.

67
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,304
Pick on someone your own size.

68
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:49,553
Peter!

69
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:51,443
Peter!

70
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:53,756
We need med packs.

71
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:08,882
Nebula.

72
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:10,187
Piss off!

73
00:12:56,436 --> 00:12:57,936
That hurt.

74
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:59,709
What a pity.

75
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:17,825
No!

76
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,090
All I did was activate the med pack!

77
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:25,208
Get them off! Now!

78
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:09,739
Oh, hell.

79
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:12,333
- We need to get him to the med bay.
- It's destroyed.

80
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:13,684
There's one on the ship!

81
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,856
Stitch him up and transfer
him in with the rest of batch 89.

82
00:14:58,249 --> 00:14:59,607
It's okay.

83
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:01,779
You're here with us now.

84
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:05,185
Hey, who's the new guy?

85
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,052
What kind of thing are you?

86
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:09,654
You've got like, a
mask on your face.

87
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:15,450
Mask, eyes, face, mouth.

88
00:15:15,723 --> 00:15:17,224
Does it hurts?

89
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:19,630
It's okay, friend.

90
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:22,169
Don't let them scare you.

91
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:29,107
Hurts...

92
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:54,895
It's okay.

93
00:15:57,385 --> 00:15:58,848
You're gonna be okay.

94
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,793
A kill switch?

95
00:16:03,992 --> 00:16:05,043
A device.

96
00:16:05,217 --> 00:16:07,785
Set to destruct if anyone goes
poking around inside him.

97
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,145
Or even if we use the med packs.

98
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,778
Why would a Rocket
have a kill switch?

99
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:15,442
Apparently someone considers him proprietary
technology and sent that golden lunatic to get him.

100
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:17,467
So he'll die if we operate on him?

101
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:19,848
- And he'll die if we don't.
- There has to be some way to bypass it.

102
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,496
It looks like there's a pass key
that can override the kill switch.

103
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:24,942
What do we know about
where Rocket came from?

104
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:25,903
He won't talk about it.

105
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,754
Much of the tech was developed
by a company called Orgocorp.

106
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:30,559
And there's a code on all of it.

107
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:33,364
89P13.

108
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:35,629
He's got maybe 48 hours.

109
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:41,043
- Where are you going?
- Orgocorp had to have records, right?

110
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:44,020
Maybe it'll have a way for us to
override the kill switch and save Rocket.

111
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,660
They won't just give us that information.

112
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:47,254
Well, that's why we're gonna break in.

113
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,279
And kill anyone who gets in our way!

114
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:51,012
- Not kill anyone.
- Kill a few people.

115
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:54,660
- Kill no people.
- Kill one guy, one stupid guy who no one loves.

116
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:56,395
Now you're just making it sad.

117
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,558
Kraglin, Cosmo, I need you to keep watch over
Knowhere till we're back. Couple of days tops.

118
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:02,241
- Aye, cap'n.
- Aye, comrade.

119
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:06,321
- Take back what you said that I'm a bad dog.
- Nope.

120
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:09,121
I know you don't really
think that I'm a bad dog.

121
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:11,332
- Can you please take it back?
- I will not.

122
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,574
I located the coordinates of Orgocorp.

123
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,207
I think I have a contact near there.
Maybe they can help us get in.

124
00:17:18,232 --> 00:17:19,817
Contact him.

125
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:21,942
Let's go save our friend.

126
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,182
It's good to have friends.

127
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:37,111
My poor baby.

128
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,478
Mama, it hurts.

129
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:43,658
- Do you have it?
- He does not, sire.

130
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:46,353
I tried to warn you,
High Evolutionary.

131
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,971
These Guardians are more
powerful than you think.

132
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:54,017
Or perhaps you simply overestimate
your own value, High Priestess.

133
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:57,377
No doubt, a flaw's on
top of my own design.

134
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,377
I created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment.

135
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:02,415
Beautiful numbskulls.

136
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:05,955
But your egos have
run wild. Say "ah."

137
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:09,760
And this one was
meant to be the Warlock.

138
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:11,434
The apogee of their people.

139
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:15,041
You removed Adam from
his cocoon early, my liege.

140
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:16,619
He is still a child.

141
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:19,697
No, there's something wrong
with him even outside all that.

142
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:23,424
Yes, there's something wrong with me.
I was stabbed, you extraordinary phallus---

143
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,978
He doesn't know any better. We
shall do whatever you require, my liege.

144
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:31,649
You knew of 89P13's existence
for years without alerting me.

145
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:33,830
That's not what I require!

146
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:38,697
I'm sorry, my liege.

147
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:42,111
Find 89P13 and return it to me.

148
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,735
Or, I will destroy your entire civilization

149
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,354
as is my right as your maker!

150
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:49,158
Do you understand?

151
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:56,650
Do you understand?

152
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:58,675
Yes...

153
00:20:00,353 --> 00:20:01,408
Toodle-loo.

154
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:07,072
How did 89P13 survive
after all these years, Theel?

155
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:08,588
It was always clever, sire.

156
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:10,613
Yes, that's exactly
why I want it now.

157
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:12,103
- Of course.
- Its brain.

158
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,494
That is the only reason, sire.

159
00:20:15,354 --> 00:20:18,353
But are you really trusting
the Sovereign to retrieve it?

160
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:19,799
They're merely a backup.

161
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I believe I know where they're going.

162
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,161
It's bioformed.

163
00:20:57,463 --> 00:21:00,084
Instead of being built, it's
grown from living matter.

164
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:04,373
The structure is surrounded by three
impenetrable plasmic security shields.

165
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,919
It's not gonna be easy to
break into this place, Star-Lord.

166
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:10,216
Doesn't have to be easy. I was
a professional thief, remember?

167
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:12,403
I'll jam the signals one at a time.

168
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,747
She calls me Star-Lord
when she's mad at me.

169
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:18,552
She's always mad at everyone.

170
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:21,959
It's because I was drunk.

171
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:26,771
She's right. If I haven't been drinking...

172
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:29,505
Maybe Rocket... I'm sorry.

173
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,896
It's okay, he's your best friend.

174
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:33,216
Second best friend.

175
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:36,670
Everyone around me dies.
My mother, Yondu...

176
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:39,255
- Gamora...
- Gamora isn't dead.

177
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,420
She is to us.
Do you want a zargnut?

178
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:43,726
Thank you.

179
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,287
First shield, set.

180
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:55,349
Three, two, one.

181
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:02,685
- Peter.
- What?

182
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:06,547
You had family on Earth. And you
never wanted to go back and see them?

183
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:10,373
You're my sister. That's all
the family I want or need.

184
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:13,529
Besides, it's probably just my grandpa,
okay? He was a pretty hard guy.

185
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:17,658
- Still, don't you think he...
- What?

186
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:21,404
You were abducted by Ravagers
the same day he lost his daughter.

187
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:25,505
Oh yeah, he was upset. My mom died, he screamed
at my face and he pushed me out of the room!

188
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,912
He was probably just trying to protect you.

189
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:29,700
- What are you talking about?
- What?

190
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,959
I'm talking about the people in my life who died,
and you're talking about this?

191
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,060
Second shield, set.

192
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,021
Three, two, one.

193
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:44,498
I'm only saying you've never
even gone to see if he's okay.

194
00:22:44,523 --> 00:22:45,990
He could still be alive.

195
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:49,880
My grandpa? He'd be like, 90-
something years old.

196
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,505
So he could still be alive.

197
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,530
People on Earth die
when they're like 50.

198
00:22:53,648 --> 00:22:55,154
They die when they're 50?

199
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:56,760
I don't know. Something like that.

200
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:58,545
What's even the
point of being born?

201
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,795
Exactly.

202
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:01,893
Are you about to die?

203
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,138
I'm not 50!

204
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,834
The point is, I wasn't talking
about any of this.

205
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,849
Third shield, set.

206
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:16,302
Three, two, one.

207
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:19,826
Well, not everything is about
what you are talking about.

208
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:24,904
And I'm only saying you're upset because so
many people you cared about have left you.

209
00:23:24,964 --> 00:23:26,964
But you also left someone.

210
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,552
And maybe I wanted a zargnut.

211
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:31,857
Too late. They're all gone.

212
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:45,787
Why didn't we go through?

213
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,701
We did. It's not the shield.

214
00:23:55,652 --> 00:23:57,146
Oh, hell.

215
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,209
Ravagers.

216
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:06,005
Hey guys, you're about to be
boarded by the United Ravagers.

217
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,060
You can surrender and turn over any stuff
worth anything and live. Or you can die.

218
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:12,826
It's up to you.

219
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:29,942
Drax, no, no, no! Drax!

220
00:24:29,988 --> 00:24:32,141
Guys, it's me. Peter Quill.
I'm one of you, remember?

221
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,305
Hold on!

222
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,491
- We have an appointment.
- We have an appointment.

223
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:36,929
- With who?
- With Gamora.

224
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:39,147
With Gamora.
What?

225
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:40,858
You're early.

226
00:24:57,689 --> 00:24:58,725
What are these?

227
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,750
Orgocorp uniforms.

228
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,092
You've got to wear these to move through
the Orgo without attracting attention.

229
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,019
This isn't my color.

230
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:12,485
What did you say?

231
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,510
It clashes with my eyes.

232
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,089
Put it on!

233
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:25,280
Nebula, why would you not tell me that
you've been in contact with Gamora?

234
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:26,827
Because I didn't want
you to get freaked out.

235
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:29,218
- Freaked... out?!
- Like that.

236
00:25:30,288 --> 00:25:32,663
*

237
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,413
Gamora, we're grateful for your help.

238
00:25:35,438 --> 00:25:37,546
I'm not doing this out of
the kindness of my heart.

239
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:41,233
I'm doing this for the hundred
thousand units my sister promised.

240
00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:44,038
So you're a Ravager now?

241
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:45,944
Put on the uniform.

242
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:47,969
Never pictured you as the Ravager type.

243
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:50,390
Who are you again?

244
00:25:50,524 --> 00:25:51,718
Oh, man...

245
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:57,780
OrgoCorp is in possession of some of the
most advanced cybergenetic IP in the galaxy.

246
00:25:58,006 --> 00:26:02,968
So they're heavily guarded
by the deadly Orgosentries.

247
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:06,663
Now I know you don't have
documentation to dock.

248
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:09,124
So you're gonna have to
get in there on your own.

249
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:14,179
Once in, Gamora is gonna
lead you to the records.

250
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,436
Where maybe you can find the
pass key to override the kill switch.

251
00:26:18,804 --> 00:26:21,124
And help you save the hedgehog.

252
00:26:21,524 --> 00:26:23,280
But if you get into trouble,

253
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,179
we will not be able
to bail you out.

254
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,054
Yes.

255
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:47,124
Yes, of course.

256
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:52,811
Its functioning has skyrocketed.

257
00:26:56,495 --> 00:26:59,350
That's correct, P13. Very good.

258
00:27:05,382 --> 00:27:07,155
That's the new world.

259
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:08,827
Counter-Earth.

260
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:11,866
Where the experiments will
go once they're ready.

261
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:14,522
- It blue.
- That's the sky.

262
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:15,827
Sky.

263
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:21,491
- Rocket.
- Yes, it is.

264
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:24,311
What sounds?

265
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:27,452
That's music.

266
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:30,311
- We like it?
- We do.

267
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:34,374
This recording is over 5,000 years old.

268
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,405
Which translated, is...

269
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:44,897
Be not as you are,
but as you should be.

270
00:27:45,388 --> 00:27:47,069
It's our sacred mission

271
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:50,395
to take the cacophony
of sounds around us

272
00:27:50,763 --> 00:27:53,515
and turn it into a song.

273
00:27:55,316 --> 00:28:00,600
To take an imperfect clump of
biological matter such as you,

274
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,304
and transform it into something...
perfect.

275
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:11,257
And we're halfway there, aren't we?

276
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:16,462
Come with me, P13.

277
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,600
I'd like to show you something.

278
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:25,018
We have but a single quest...

279
00:28:25,322 --> 00:28:27,444
To create the perfect species,

280
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:29,971
and the perfect society.

281
00:28:30,224 --> 00:28:32,600
You, P13,

282
00:28:32,835 --> 00:28:34,835
are part of batch 89.

283
00:28:35,306 --> 00:28:37,530
But here, with batch 90,

284
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:41,108
I've developed a process
by which I can guide

285
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:48,679
any organism through millions of years of
programmed evolution changes, in a moment.

286
00:29:19,449 --> 00:29:20,788
See now...

287
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,319
There's the rub.

288
00:29:24,303 --> 00:29:27,460
For some reason, these specimens

289
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:32,952
are also over producing the legobeta
microsamino protein in their systems.

290
00:29:32,977 --> 00:29:34,670
Causing them to be, well...

291
00:29:34,695 --> 00:29:37,077
Violent. We don't like it.

292
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:40,702
A utopia cannot have its denizens
murdering one another, can it?

293
00:29:41,274 --> 00:29:42,482
They can't.

294
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:45,499
- Can't.
- Can't.

295
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:46,717
Theel.

296
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:54,139
They're programmed to be peaceful, like you.

297
00:29:54,296 --> 00:29:57,295
But for some reason, it's not catching.

298
00:29:58,124 --> 00:29:59,874
Tectonic filters.

299
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:01,356
What?

300
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:05,514
They suppresaliding the glycusoride sources.

301
00:30:05,812 --> 00:30:07,585
And then, boop, boop, boop...

302
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,780
Absisting residual deformity.

303
00:30:09,805 --> 00:30:12,420
And then, they, make, um...

304
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,538
- What do you say?
- The legobeta Microsamino proteins.

305
00:30:16,563 --> 00:30:18,155
Yeah, thems.

306
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,858
And then, angry turtleses.

307
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:12,238
There, that's the decompression chamber.

308
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:13,948
Lock in.

309
00:31:24,123 --> 00:31:25,142
Go.

310
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:57,228
Activate gravity boots and gloves.

311
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:07,231
Nebula, go.

312
00:32:42,571 --> 00:32:44,294
So you really don't remember anything?

313
00:32:44,688 --> 00:32:45,707
Like what?

314
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:49,161
- Bunch of time with us.
- No.

315
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:53,059
- Well, we were...
- We weren't anything.

316
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:57,778
- You and me...
- That was some alternate future version of me.

317
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:00,278
Wasn't me.

318
00:33:01,884 --> 00:33:03,012
We loved each other.

319
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,567
I don't think so.

320
00:33:08,747 --> 00:33:10,621
I know you don't remember any of it...

321
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:14,676
You were everything to me.

322
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:18,957
I miss you.

323
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,793
So much.

324
00:33:23,145 --> 00:33:24,231
And maybe...

325
00:33:25,146 --> 00:33:27,356
Maybe if you open yourself up to it...

326
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:32,114
- There's a possibility...
- I don't think so, Quinn.

327
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:35,512
- Quill.
- Quill.

328
00:33:37,496 --> 00:33:38,676
I don't think so.

329
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:40,160
But what I'm trying to say...

330
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,691
Peter, you know this
is an open line, right?

331
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:45,214
- What?
- We're listening to everything you're saying.

332
00:33:45,301 --> 00:33:47,441
And it is painful.

333
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:48,597
And you're just telling me now?

334
00:33:48,622 --> 00:33:50,300
We were hoping it
would stall on its own.

335
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:51,488
But I switched it over to private.

336
00:33:51,513 --> 00:33:52,925
What color button did you push?

337
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,292
Blue. For the blue suit.

338
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:56,972
- Oh, no.
- Blue is the open line for everyone.

339
00:33:56,997 --> 00:33:58,222
Orange is for blue.

340
00:33:58,267 --> 00:34:00,160
- What?
- Black is for orange.

341
00:34:00,187 --> 00:34:02,660
Yellow is for green.
Green is for red.

342
00:34:02,685 --> 00:34:03,941
And red is for yellow.

343
00:34:03,966 --> 00:34:05,542
No, yellow is for yellow.

344
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,246
Green is for red.
Red is for green.

345
00:34:07,271 --> 00:34:09,105
- I don't think so.
- Try it, then.

346
00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:12,607
Hello!

347
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:16,691
- You were right.
- How the hell am I supposed to know all of that!?

348
00:34:16,716 --> 00:34:18,050
Seems intuitive.

349
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:20,581
Can we get back to saving our friend?

350
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:23,576
Get that jammer ready
to change the shield.

351
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,467
Guys?

352
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:03,646
You wanna talk about a sweet ride?
The acceleration would crush your spine.

353
00:35:03,671 --> 00:35:06,756
It's got that brand new Fusilux core.
You know what I'm talking about?

354
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:09,201
- Oh, yeah.
- Really? Because I just made that up.

355
00:35:09,845 --> 00:35:11,295
Oh, I thought you
said something else.

356
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:13,428
Master Karja.

357
00:35:15,174 --> 00:35:17,174
- No, you didn't.
- I did... I did.

358
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:21,053
Master Karja, there appears to be a physical
breach in the white wing somewhere.

359
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:21,982
Could it be a glitch?

360
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:23,092
Maybe?

361
00:35:29,217 --> 00:35:30,662
I'm accessing the eye.

362
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:32,185
I'll see if I can locate it.

363
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:08,001
There's some sort of anomaly in the decompression
chamber. Best to check it out, Master.

364
00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:09,345
On it.

365
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:11,212
Hurry.

366
00:36:23,288 --> 00:36:24,361
Where do we put these?

367
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:28,838
Here! Hide them in this
locker until we leave.

368
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:37,072
Hurry.

369
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:55,621
What the hell was that, guys?

370
00:36:57,903 --> 00:36:59,473
Are you kidding me?

371
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:03,565
- What?
- A neutral cork just hit the satellite.

372
00:37:04,028 --> 00:37:09,739
It's burning a hole thru the wall. You geniuses just
throw the door open without any precautionary procedure?

373
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:11,247
What procedure, bro?

374
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:15,114
Oh, you want us to read the
manual for you too, bro?

375
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:17,139
You could have killed everyone in the wing.

376
00:37:17,244 --> 00:37:19,244
Exactly, you idiots!

377
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:21,137
I'm angry, too.

378
00:37:21,162 --> 00:37:22,192
Oh, no.

379
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:26,747
Can't you see these authentic mechanic
uniforms we're wearing on our bodies?

380
00:37:26,854 --> 00:37:29,277
That blend in with some of our
skin tones better than others?

381
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:33,301
Excuse my friend. He's the
boss' nephew. He's a little...

382
00:37:35,979 --> 00:37:38,308
Oh...
Oh.

383
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:41,769
Yeah, I...
I got one of those too.

384
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:45,722
This one? This one, I love.
I'm so proud of...

385
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,457
You're doing great.
So proud of you.

386
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:49,512
But this one...
I just...

387
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:58,619
Everything he does drives me crazy.

388
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,904
- I thought you said something else.
- Shut up.

389
00:38:01,827 --> 00:38:03,104
I swear I'm gonna throttle him.

390
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:04,963
I'm gonna go to jail for murder.
I am.

391
00:38:05,468 --> 00:38:06,807
How did you guys get here so fast?

392
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:11,010
Gonna be honest with you, we just happened
in before it burned all the way through, thankfully.

393
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:12,963
Good thing you were here.

394
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,150
Alright guys, wrap it up.

395
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:17,175
Looks like we're all clear here.

396
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,237
Our spacesuits!

397
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,785
You threw them in the contamination bin.

398
00:38:28,816 --> 00:38:31,426
It expels stuff into space the
moment you shut the door.

399
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:34,465
That would have been helpful
information three minutes ago!

400
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,738
Dammit, Mantis, why don't you ever think?

401
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:38,441
Oh, are we pretending
to be angry again?

402
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,098
Mantis, you asshole!

403
00:38:40,123 --> 00:38:42,512
Guys, just focus for two seconds.

404
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,957
We'll find another way
out of here. Right now...

405
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,754
We need to save Rocket's life.

406
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:51,504
Nebula, Quinn and I will get to
the records and get the pass key.

407
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:56,371
Bug and doufus, access the spaceport thru the
elevator so Tree can land and get us out of here.

408
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,340
- Oh, apologies.
- No problem.

409
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:01,894
Go.

410
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:19,113
It's not my fault I don't know what
something is. No one ever tells me.

411
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:20,762
I didn't even want to come here.

412
00:39:20,787 --> 00:39:22,019
I'm gonna need to see your...

413
00:39:22,044 --> 00:39:25,762
You're hopelessly in love... with him.

414
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:27,387
Oh, no...

415
00:39:28,193 --> 00:39:30,316
- Hey.
- Hey.

416
00:39:31,974 --> 00:39:33,275
How are you doing today?

417
00:39:33,842 --> 00:39:35,129
I'm alright.

418
00:39:37,803 --> 00:39:39,988
What was your name again?

419
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:41,723
Drax the Destroyer.

420
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:45,191
That's such a lovely name.

421
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:47,340
I'll get the door for you.

422
00:39:49,665 --> 00:39:51,988
- I'll be here when you come back out, okay?
- Sure.

423
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,059
Every single time.

424
00:39:56,822 --> 00:39:58,691
My name is Brittle Snorte!

425
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:02,098
Welcome to OrgoCorp headquarters.

426
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:09,527
For over 300 years OrgoCorp has been producing cybernetic
implants and genetic upgrades across the universe.

427
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:12,926
Under the watchful eye
of the High Evolutionary.

428
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,465
That warning we got today. Don't
those two match the description?

429
00:40:18,194 --> 00:40:20,194
Attention all Orgosentries.

430
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:24,215
That manager should
have access to the records.

431
00:40:25,445 --> 00:40:27,824
If the pass key is here,
she can get it for us.

432
00:40:28,517 --> 00:40:29,566
All right.

433
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:31,916
- I'll handle this one.
- How?

434
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,199
Pure Star-Lord charm.

435
00:40:34,652 --> 00:40:37,363
I'm excited that you get to see
this again for the first time.

436
00:40:44,669 --> 00:40:46,669
Hi, Yura.

437
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:48,832
- Ura.
- Oh, Ura.

438
00:40:48,857 --> 00:40:51,754
- Hi.
- Hi, my name is Patrick Swayze.

439
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:54,887
I've been noticing you
for quite a while.

440
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:58,793
And whenever you smile to yourself,
when you think nobody is looking,

441
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:01,248
it makes my everyday a bit brighter.

442
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,787
We need your hand, and it's your choice
whether it's on your body, or not!

443
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:06,138
What are you doing?

444
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,654
She was never gonna fall for that.

445
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,107
She was totally into me, man.

446
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:10,787
I kinda thought you
were a douchebag.

447
00:41:10,812 --> 00:41:11,724
Oh, come on.

448
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:12,927
- We need a file.
- What file?

449
00:41:12,952 --> 00:41:15,373
89P13. Would that be something?

450
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:18,365
- No.
- Then your use to us is over.

451
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,349
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

452
00:41:19,374 --> 00:41:21,084
Sounds like a species tag.

453
00:41:22,094 --> 00:41:23,349
Show us!

454
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:30,826
All of our research supports the High
Evolutionary's altruistic objective,

455
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:33,709
of creating a utopian society.

456
00:41:33,714 --> 00:41:35,714
That must be the spaceport.

457
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,701
Whoa.

458
00:41:42,987 --> 00:41:44,224
What is all this?

459
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:47,990
Species patented over the
years using OrgoCorp tech.

460
00:41:48,129 --> 00:41:52,295
Every species Orgocorp has created
has its own individual file.

461
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:56,052
I am so sorry about this. Listen to me,
this is not the kinda thing we do.

462
00:41:56,077 --> 00:41:58,545
Oh, please, stop it
with the subtle jabs!

463
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,982
Old you would've never done this.

464
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:02,232
You had a purpose higher than
yourself, the calling to help people.

465
00:42:02,257 --> 00:42:04,257
That's why you left Thanos
and formed the Guardians.

466
00:42:04,282 --> 00:42:07,974
Except I didn't form the Guardians
and I barely left Thanos.

467
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:11,201
Whoever it was that
you were in love with,

468
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:13,615
it wasn't me.

469
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:15,404
It sounds more like her.

470
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:16,365
- Her?
- What?

471
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,873
- That's ridiculous...
- Do not drag me into this.

472
00:42:24,366 --> 00:42:25,807
- Knock it off!
- What?

473
00:42:25,832 --> 00:42:28,557
Don't look at me like a lost puppy
needing a safe place to lie down!

474
00:42:28,582 --> 00:42:30,268
I didn't say anything.

475
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
I just never noticed how
black your eyes were.

476
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,606
They were replaced by my father

477
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,731
as a method of torture.

478
00:42:43,756 --> 00:42:46,229
He picked a pretty set.

479
00:42:48,522 --> 00:42:49,574
There.

480
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,137
That's the file for 89P13.

481
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:21,546
Oh, no.

482
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,116
Walk!

483
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:27,764
Run, run.

484
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,077
Stand down!

485
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:37,874
Drax, we should make a run for it.

486
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,350
- Or we can fight.
- Run.

487
00:43:39,365 --> 00:43:40,733
- Fight.
- Run!

488
00:43:40,742 --> 00:43:43,381
- Fight!
- Take 'em!

489
00:43:47,718 --> 00:43:49,054
What are we going to do?

490
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:52,061
- I got a plan.
- What is it?

491
00:43:52,086 --> 00:43:53,194
All of you, come with---

492
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:58,139
Everybody, lower your weapons or
I blow this woman's brain out!

493
00:43:58,164 --> 00:43:59,475
That's the plan?

494
00:44:00,234 --> 00:44:01,327
You're a kitty cat.

495
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:07,019
You feel like dancing.

496
00:44:08,674 --> 00:44:09,913
Violent rage.

497
00:44:15,979 --> 00:44:17,582
Lower your weapons!

498
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:24,113
Now kill that one that looks like a
carrot to show we mean business.

499
00:44:24,983 --> 00:44:27,121
God! Past Gamora's just mean!

500
00:44:27,146 --> 00:44:30,074
She was always like that,
and yet I was the bad guy.

501
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:32,099
We are not killing anyone!

502
00:44:32,156 --> 00:44:33,410
Back off!

503
00:44:35,653 --> 00:44:38,324
Groot, bring the Bowie to us. Now!

504
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:52,254
- I'm so sorry about this, Ura.
- Oh, please.

505
00:44:52,324 --> 00:44:55,793
We're here to save the
life of our friend. That is all.

506
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,621
We paid her to help
us get in and get out.

507
00:44:59,646 --> 00:45:02,441
You'd think that'd mean, "oh, I'm gonna help them do
it in a way that no one knows what's happening."

508
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:05,840
But no. What she means is I'm gonna
shoot people. Threaten people's lives.

509
00:45:05,865 --> 00:45:07,387
Shut up!

510
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:11,059
And now I know you're probably
asking "why would I trust her?" Well...

511
00:45:11,187 --> 00:45:12,582
That's a good question.

512
00:45:12,808 --> 00:45:14,371
The answer is...

513
00:45:14,737 --> 00:45:16,199
We used to be in love.

514
00:45:16,253 --> 00:45:20,160
Yeah, she was my girlfriend. Only she
doesn't remember it because it wasn't her.

515
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:24,652
Because her dad threw her off a magic cliff and she died.
Then I lost my temper and nearly destroyed half the universe.

516
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:28,190
And she came back.
Out of the past. There she is.

517
00:45:28,657 --> 00:45:32,566
Anyone else who died in the past stayed dead.
Not her. Why? Was it the magic cliff? I don't know.

518
00:45:32,884 --> 00:45:35,207
I'm not some freakin'
Infinity Stone scientist.

519
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:40,007
Just some dumbass Earth dude
who met a girl, fell in love.

520
00:45:40,378 --> 00:45:42,145
That girl died,

521
00:45:42,223 --> 00:45:44,488
and then came
back a total dick.

522
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,684
You left out some important
information, but...

523
00:45:50,285 --> 00:45:51,949
That is the gist of it.

524
00:45:58,583 --> 00:45:59,801
Get to the security helm.

525
00:45:59,826 --> 00:46:01,066
Okay!

526
00:46:09,996 --> 00:46:12,780
Everybody down on the floor
or we blow your brains out.

527
00:46:12,805 --> 00:46:14,936
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
We don't want any---

528
00:46:17,304 --> 00:46:19,960
Come on! Will you please
stop doing that?

529
00:46:45,366 --> 00:46:47,366
Hey!

530
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,379
Run.

531
00:47:35,325 --> 00:47:37,170
Drax!

532
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:42,655
Get on the ground, and
show me your hands now.

533
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,670
Ura...

534
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,991
Please listen to me. We need
to get out of here with this.

535
00:47:57,131 --> 00:47:58,772
To save my best friend's life.

536
00:47:59,218 --> 00:48:03,170
If you can get us into the systems of those
sentries out there, they are good people, like you...

537
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:04,569
I'm certain of it.

538
00:48:04,594 --> 00:48:06,639
And if I just had an
opportunity to speak to them...

539
00:48:06,665 --> 00:48:09,255
They're corporate shills, you idiot.
They're not gonna listen.

540
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,812
They will listen if I speak
to them from my heart.

541
00:48:13,092 --> 00:48:14,264
Ura...

542
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:16,069
please.

543
00:48:25,551 --> 00:48:26,663
Hey!

544
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:31,514
Come out now!

545
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:33,532
Damn it!

546
00:48:35,904 --> 00:48:36,928
Stop!

547
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,764
You are in.

548
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:45,659
- Tell them your truce---
- Yeah, I'm not that big of an idiot.

549
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:47,499
I just needed to get
into the system.

550
00:49:01,401 --> 00:49:02,670
Told you she was into me.

551
00:49:24,068 --> 00:49:25,368
I am Groot.

552
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:28,321
Yeah. That looked cool.

553
00:49:37,734 --> 00:49:39,734
Is sky?

554
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:41,992
No.

555
00:49:42,096 --> 00:49:45,203
That's not sky. That's a ceiling.

556
00:49:45,987 --> 00:49:49,421
Sire is making a
new world for all of us.

557
00:49:49,522 --> 00:49:51,359
And when we get there,

558
00:49:51,598 --> 00:49:53,296
there will be sky,

559
00:49:53,565 --> 00:49:55,565
and it will be beautiful.

560
00:49:55,616 --> 00:49:57,328
And forever.

561
00:50:01,947 --> 00:50:03,947
I have been thinking.

562
00:50:04,792 --> 00:50:05,906
About what?

563
00:50:05,944 --> 00:50:08,265
Oh, nothing in particular.

564
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:12,258
But I thought, since you
guys are my closest friends,

565
00:50:12,348 --> 00:50:14,148
and my only friends,

566
00:50:14,432 --> 00:50:18,867
you might be interested in knowing
that I have been thinking.

567
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,503
That's cool.

568
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:22,937
I've been thinking, too.

569
00:50:23,003 --> 00:50:25,640
About something more singular.

570
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:28,805
When sire moves
us to the new world,

571
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:30,937
we're gonna need names.

572
00:50:31,773 --> 00:50:36,890
I mean, 89Q12...
Not really a name.

573
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:38,859
So...

574
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:41,992
I would like my name to be...

575
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:44,242
Lylla.

576
00:50:44,982 --> 00:50:46,289
Lylla.

577
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:47,882
Lylla.

578
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:49,546
Lylla.

579
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:51,757
That's a pretty name, Lylla.

580
00:50:52,947 --> 00:50:54,367
Thank you.

581
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,593
I think my name shall be Teefs.

582
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,932
Because although
we all do have them,

583
00:51:02,254 --> 00:51:04,648
mine are definitely
the most prominent.

584
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:08,273
- Teefs.
- Teefs.

585
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,765
- Lylla.
- Teefs.

586
00:51:10,843 --> 00:51:12,703
Me be called Floor...

587
00:51:12,757 --> 00:51:15,593
Because me is lying on floor.

588
00:51:15,675 --> 00:51:18,921
You're lying on a floor,
so your name is Floor?

589
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:21,472
Yeah.

590
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:23,957
Floor.

591
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,269
What about you, friend?

592
00:51:29,617 --> 00:51:33,300
Someday, I'm gonna make
great machines that fly.

593
00:51:33,936 --> 00:51:37,019
And me and my friends are
going to go flying together.

594
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:40,582
Into the forever
and beautiful sky.

595
00:51:41,175 --> 00:51:45,035
Lylla, and Teefs, and Floor...

596
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:46,894
And me.

597
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:49,160
Rocket.

598
00:51:51,954 --> 00:51:53,457
Rocket.

599
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,777
It really is good to have friends.

600
00:51:57,562 --> 00:51:58,582
Yeah.

601
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:05,886
Start the incision here.

602
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:09,816
Keep calm.

603
00:52:12,848 --> 00:52:16,714
- Hold it still.
- I can't. It won't stop moving!

604
00:52:18,044 --> 00:52:21,035
Why did he never tell
us about any of this?

605
00:52:21,178 --> 00:52:23,722
This is worse than what
Thanos did to me.

606
00:52:25,307 --> 00:52:26,738
But what about the pass key?

607
00:52:27,078 --> 00:52:28,191
Is it there?

608
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,402
No. But a file was
removed today.

609
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,925
Downloaded and deleted a
million characters at length.

610
00:52:37,022 --> 00:52:39,222
The biometrics say
it was this man.

611
00:52:39,247 --> 00:52:41,247
Recorder B2H6.

612
00:52:41,482 --> 00:52:43,355
I saw this guy outside
of records today.

613
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,886
Looks like one of the
High Evolutionary's recorders.

614
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:50,277
The High Evolutionary?

615
00:52:50,822 --> 00:52:52,207
The founder of OrgoCorp?

616
00:52:52,232 --> 00:52:56,261
OrgoCorp is just a way to fund his
experiments that lie outside intergalactic laws.

617
00:52:56,401 --> 00:52:58,574
He's created whole societies.

618
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,011
Xeronians, the Animen.

619
00:53:01,036 --> 00:53:02,238
- Sovereign.
- The Sovereign?

620
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:04,707
Corners of the universe
consider him god.

621
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:08,376
- I am Groot.
- Yes.

622
00:53:08,662 --> 00:53:10,019
Yes, what? That he's Groot?

623
00:53:10,044 --> 00:53:13,472
He said maybe this man downloaded the
pass key into the computer on his head.

624
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:14,659
Huh?

625
00:53:14,684 --> 00:53:17,050
That can store the pass key.

626
00:53:17,075 --> 00:53:18,840
If we find him, we save Rocket.

627
00:53:19,618 --> 00:53:22,004
The High Evolutionary's coordinates.

628
00:53:23,244 --> 00:53:24,754
Put the coordinates in the nav.

629
00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:26,410
Wait a minute.

630
00:53:26,435 --> 00:53:27,863
Are you kidding me?

631
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:31,254
What he wants is that
gutted badger in the med bay.

632
00:53:31,279 --> 00:53:33,279
And you're gonna bring
it straight to him?

633
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:35,441
It's almost certainly a trap.

634
00:53:35,466 --> 00:53:38,355
A trap isn't a trap if you know the trap
is trying to trap you. It's a face-off.

635
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:40,246
A face-off is a trap

636
00:53:40,271 --> 00:53:44,340
if you're facing off against a guy a thousand
times more powerful than you.

637
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,121
Do you know who
the High Evolutionary is?

638
00:53:47,146 --> 00:53:50,340
Yeah, he's some dickhead who
dissected my best friend.

639
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:51,300
Second best.

640
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:54,465
The High Evolutionary isn't someone
you wanna think about messing with.

641
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,402
We won't think about
it when we do it.

642
00:53:56,669 --> 00:53:58,519
You know what? I don't care.

643
00:53:58,544 --> 00:54:01,965
Just drop me off with the Ravagers and
you go do whatever it is you wanna do.

644
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,199
We don't have time for this.

645
00:54:03,224 --> 00:54:05,738
I'm not asking you. Drop me
off with my people now.

646
00:54:05,763 --> 00:54:07,261
Your people?

647
00:54:07,392 --> 00:54:10,847
The Ravagers aren't your people.
I'm a damn Ravager. You aren't.

648
00:54:12,217 --> 00:54:15,012
Listen, I know you were always
looking for a family, okay?

649
00:54:15,037 --> 00:54:17,871
But my Gamora, the one I loved, she
didn't find it with a group of criminals.

650
00:54:17,896 --> 00:54:19,316
She found it with us.

651
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:21,597
People who care about you.

652
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:23,811
I know that's who you still are.

653
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:26,043
Somewhere inside of you...

654
00:54:29,569 --> 00:54:34,535
What are you so afraid of in yourself,
that I need to be something for you?

655
00:54:34,715 --> 00:54:37,480
I don't give a shit
about your Gamora!

656
00:54:37,505 --> 00:54:39,793
Life made me me!

657
00:54:41,475 --> 00:54:44,418
I have a few upgrades courtesy of
that gutted badger in the med bay.

658
00:54:44,443 --> 00:54:47,566
And we are not risking his life
to make yours more convenient.

659
00:54:47,591 --> 00:54:50,746
- I'm family.
- So is he.

660
00:54:54,864 --> 00:54:56,097
Screw you.

661
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,420
Screw all of you.

662
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,267
Found him on the outskirts
of the first shield,

663
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:16,449
pirating supply ships.

664
00:55:17,511 --> 00:55:19,207
I do appreciate this, good sir.

665
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:22,980
And I appreciate your contribution
to the Orgosentry retirement fund.

666
00:55:23,116 --> 00:55:24,379
Your associate.

667
00:55:25,014 --> 00:55:27,824
A Zehoberi named Gamora.

668
00:55:28,196 --> 00:55:30,285
- Where is she now.
- You'll get nothing from me!

669
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:32,996
Oh, we'll see about
that, won't we?

670
00:55:33,613 --> 00:55:35,004
Adam.

671
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,355
Adam!

672
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:40,184
- Yes, mother.
- Show him we mean business.

673
00:56:01,693 --> 00:56:04,021
I said show him we mean business!

674
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:05,091
Not disintegrate him!

675
00:56:05,116 --> 00:56:06,544
Well, what business could
we have shown him?

676
00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:08,239
But now he is
of no use to us!

677
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:09,591
Well let's just question the man's friend!

678
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,419
Friend? You think that's
a friend? It's an animal!

679
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,193
He looks sad.

680
00:56:18,026 --> 00:56:20,224
I really don't enjoy how that's
making me feel, actually.

681
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,255
Your friend's a moron. I got
one of those, too. I get it.

682
00:56:26,872 --> 00:56:28,153
Outpost?

683
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:29,935
This is Gamora. Are you there?

684
00:56:32,406 --> 00:56:34,060
If you can pick this up, come in.

685
00:56:39,367 --> 00:56:40,982
Outpost, come in.

686
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:43,646
Yes, Gamora.

687
00:56:44,246 --> 00:56:45,536
Salutations.

688
00:56:45,855 --> 00:56:47,122
May I help?

689
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,937
Well, I need you guys
to come pick me up.

690
00:56:49,962 --> 00:56:52,888
I'm gonna upload the location
link to the craft I'm on.

691
00:56:53,037 --> 00:56:54,872
Oh, I think we can arrange that.

692
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:54,943
You need to say to him exactly
what I told you to say.

693
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:56,786
Why don't you just say it?

694
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:58,811
No one ever listens to me.

695
00:58:14,215 --> 00:58:15,326
Quill.

696
00:58:16,283 --> 00:58:18,013
Life is a pond.

697
00:58:18,513 --> 00:58:24,393
And you spent your entire life leaping from woman
to woman, as if they are lily pads upon this great pond.

698
00:58:24,807 --> 00:58:27,263
Perhaps what you need to do, Quill...

699
00:58:28,618 --> 00:58:30,255
... is learn to swim.

700
00:58:33,861 --> 00:58:36,130
- That actually made sense.
- Yes it made sense.

701
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:38,584
No, I mean, 'cause that's
sort of an analogy.

702
00:58:39,147 --> 00:58:42,403
I didn't know that you were
capable of that... I thought...

703
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:44,489
I know lots of analogies, Quill.

704
00:58:44,676 --> 00:58:46,974
Analogies, metaphors, etcetera?

705
00:58:48,037 --> 00:58:49,107
For instance...

706
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:52,466
Gamora's head is like a lily pad.

707
00:58:52,703 --> 00:58:53,964
Because it's green.

708
00:58:55,195 --> 00:58:56,435
Analogy.

709
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:59,318
And also, stupid-looking and flappy.

710
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:02,693
- Flappy?
- Because her skin is made of leaf.

711
00:59:03,159 --> 00:59:05,247
- Metaphor.
- Is it?

712
00:59:05,282 --> 00:59:08,903
Yesterday, I made a poop
shaped like a fish.

713
00:59:09,009 --> 00:59:12,919
Even my butt, is capable
of making an analogy.

714
00:59:16,685 --> 00:59:17,716
Oh.

715
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:24,466
What's happening?

716
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:26,161
The fluid is in his lungs.

717
00:59:27,345 --> 00:59:29,021
P13!

718
00:59:30,245 --> 00:59:31,630
P13!

719
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:34,505
Sire.

720
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:37,036
P13!

721
00:59:42,857 --> 00:59:47,021
Sire was in the middle of his treatment,
soon we had a breakthrough with that tube.

722
00:59:47,053 --> 00:59:48,880
Perhaps then we should resume tomorrow...

723
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:50,881
We will not resume tomorrow, no!

724
00:59:51,115 --> 00:59:52,522
P13

725
00:59:55,638 --> 00:59:56,747
Oh, ooh, there you are.

726
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:07,818
Hello.

727
01:00:18,544 --> 01:00:24,311
How did you know about
the microsamino proteins, P13?

728
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,940
What happened in there?

729
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:51,676
Why?

730
01:00:52,266 --> 01:00:55,060
How did you know, P13?

731
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,731
It was too little filtration.

732
01:00:56,756 --> 01:00:59,727
In the hyperthermic, yes, we know.
We fixed that.

733
01:00:59,772 --> 01:01:01,450
But how did you know?

734
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,434
I made you!

735
01:01:04,534 --> 01:01:06,534
How did you know!?

736
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:12,184
Because it worked.

737
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:20,340
It worked...

738
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:25,590
The rage, is gone.

739
01:01:26,212 --> 01:01:29,200
We have the peaceful creatures
we always sought...

740
01:01:29,225 --> 01:01:31,786
Ready to inhabit the new world.

741
01:01:34,477 --> 01:01:36,477
We're going to the new world?

742
01:01:37,258 --> 01:01:39,903
Oh... we?

743
01:01:42,404 --> 01:01:43,856
Look at you.

744
01:01:43,998 --> 01:01:48,317
It's if you were cobbled
together by fat-fingered children.

745
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:51,262
How could you be part
of a perfect species?

746
01:01:51,325 --> 01:01:53,011
You're simply a...

747
01:01:53,189 --> 01:01:58,489
medley of mistakes we could learn from in
the plight of the creatures that truly matter.

748
01:01:59,364 --> 01:02:01,067
Batch 89...

749
01:02:01,487 --> 01:02:04,504
was never meant for
the new world, P13.

750
01:02:04,656 --> 01:02:10,020
You could figure out the complex workings
of cytoplasmic filtration systems,

751
01:02:10,074 --> 01:02:12,074
but you couldn't figure out that?

752
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:17,637
But that brain...

753
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,920
That, I'd like to study further.

754
01:02:25,543 --> 01:02:28,997
Prep it for surgery and
removal in the morning.

755
01:02:29,857 --> 01:02:32,184
What about the rest
of batch 89, sire?

756
01:02:35,553 --> 01:02:37,028
Incinerate them.

757
01:02:44,873 --> 01:02:47,777
He's dying. We need that pass key.

758
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:49,747
We don't have long.

759
01:02:50,944 --> 01:02:52,387
We've arrived.

760
01:03:07,652 --> 01:03:11,069
That looks just like... home.

761
01:03:23,965 --> 01:03:25,811
It's like a replica of Earth.

762
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:27,218
It makes no sense.

763
01:03:27,293 --> 01:03:30,468
Atmosphere is habitable.
Gravity is and/or minus one.

764
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:26,577
Hello. We mean
you no harm.

765
01:04:37,621 --> 01:04:39,865
Listen to me, he was just trying
to throw her back the ball.

766
01:04:45,635 --> 01:04:46,834
Please, no...

767
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:49,537
Hey! Hey.

768
01:04:49,562 --> 01:04:51,662
Groot! Full kaiju!

769
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:56,818
- Not full kaiju!
- I am Groooooot!

770
01:05:02,763 --> 01:05:04,201
Get down, Groot!

771
01:05:04,664 --> 01:05:06,373
Everybody, it's okay.
Hey.

772
01:05:06,707 --> 01:05:08,707
Hi. We're not here to harm you.

773
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:12,193
Okay... you see?

774
01:05:13,897 --> 01:05:15,179
For your knee.

775
01:05:17,676 --> 01:05:19,350
We just need to
save our friend.

776
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,514
It doesn't belong here.

777
01:05:28,043 --> 01:05:30,043
I will train it in the
ways of the Sovereign.

778
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:34,639
I will train him not to do that.

779
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,982
The blasphemy
even having it here.

780
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:39,256
Kill it! Now.

781
01:05:39,968 --> 01:05:43,889
I'm the Warlock, mum, and I'm
done of being ordered around.

782
01:05:45,223 --> 01:05:46,756
Gamora is here.

783
01:05:47,685 --> 01:05:50,303
Which means the squirrel is, also...

784
01:05:50,401 --> 01:05:54,514
To save ourselves, we must bring it to the
High Evolutionary before his own people do.

785
01:06:19,045 --> 01:06:21,279
Yeah, yeah. Sit. Let's sit.

786
01:06:21,547 --> 01:06:22,553
Okay.

787
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:33,127
I am Groot.

788
01:06:33,233 --> 01:06:34,986
It's not rude, it's what it's here for.

789
01:06:35,011 --> 01:06:37,369
Drax, sit up! Idiot.

790
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:41,022
Thank you.

791
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:46,385
Thank you.

792
01:06:47,862 --> 01:06:49,666
Our friend,

793
01:06:50,944 --> 01:06:52,143
he's dying.

794
01:06:58,353 --> 01:07:01,533
We love our friend.

795
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,322
But he is dying.

796
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,697
That's not dying.
That's already dead.

797
01:07:09,757 --> 01:07:11,189
They'll think he's already dead.

798
01:07:11,214 --> 01:07:13,338
They'll think we are
here on a quest for revenge.

799
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,244
Drax, sit up!

800
01:07:15,269 --> 01:07:17,408
- That's what it's here for.
- Drax, it isn't.

801
01:07:17,475 --> 01:07:21,619
It's made for people to sit shoulder to shoulder right
next to each other. Get your boots off their pillows.

802
01:07:21,644 --> 01:07:24,205
I find it hard to believe it doesn't
have a multiple purpose.

803
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:26,689
I'm sorry. My friend is a dumbass.

804
01:07:27,776 --> 01:07:29,377
That's the same as your dying.

805
01:07:29,402 --> 01:07:31,252
Why do you criticize everything?

806
01:07:31,277 --> 01:07:32,369
So why is the couch long then?

807
01:07:32,394 --> 01:07:34,291
It was a totally different sound.

808
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:37,127
No it isn't. Ugh! Dying... ugh!
Dumbass... see? It's the same.

809
01:07:37,152 --> 01:07:39,963
Alright, guys. Can I proceed, please?

810
01:07:39,988 --> 01:07:41,111
We're trying to save our friend.

811
01:07:41,136 --> 01:07:42,416
Drax, I see you.

812
01:07:43,776 --> 01:07:48,252
I understand that none of this
makes any sense to you right now.

813
01:07:48,786 --> 01:07:50,786
We need your help

814
01:07:51,588 --> 01:07:53,994
in finding a man.

815
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:58,322
I'm gonna draw. I'm gonna draw
the man that we're looking for.

816
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,392
You see the thing on her head?
He has a thing...

817
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:06,518
That is delightful.

818
01:08:08,177 --> 01:08:09,369
There you go.

819
01:08:09,924 --> 01:08:12,221
Have you seen this man?

820
01:08:14,071 --> 01:08:15,783
That's very good.

821
01:08:15,808 --> 01:08:17,697
Can I have that later to hang
on my apartment, please?

822
01:08:17,832 --> 01:08:19,643
Yeah, thank you.

823
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,986
His name? His name is Motio?

824
01:08:41,828 --> 01:08:44,314
Many Motios. There?

825
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:46,611
That pyramid?

826
01:08:48,856 --> 01:08:51,705
Is that your car
in the driveway?

827
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,596
Drax, stay here with Rocket.

828
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:01,291
Watch him, that's who
they're coming for.

829
01:09:01,316 --> 01:09:02,713
- I want to come!
- No.

830
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:04,447
Mantis, watch Drax.

831
01:09:04,472 --> 01:09:07,181
Groot, you know what
to do with these.

832
01:09:14,508 --> 01:09:15,822
Push down on it.

833
01:09:15,855 --> 01:09:17,088
- What?
- Push it down.

834
01:09:17,113 --> 01:09:18,439
I am pushing down on it.

835
01:09:18,464 --> 01:09:19,838
Push the button.

836
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,142
Looks like you're pushing the keyhole.

837
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:24,424
- What?
- There's a button under the handle.

838
01:09:24,633 --> 01:09:25,955
Press that in.

839
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,056
Okay. Now what?

840
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:30,533
Open the fucking door!

841
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:34,789
That is a stupid design.

842
01:09:34,814 --> 01:09:37,400
And the instructions
were very unclear!

843
01:09:38,243 --> 01:09:40,243
Let's get that pass key
and save our friend.

844
01:09:47,088 --> 01:09:50,950
I was 8 years old when I left Earth, okay? Why would
I know any more about driving one of these than you do?

845
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,185
Don't say you're volunteering.

846
01:09:52,217 --> 01:09:53,692
- You want me to drive? I'll drive.
- No!

847
01:09:53,717 --> 01:09:55,911
I don't want you
to drive. I got this.

848
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:42,942
You must be
a really loyal pet

849
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,419
if they're willing to
do all this for you.

850
01:11:55,496 --> 01:11:57,211
This is the perfect society?

851
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:19,510
Sire...

852
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:23,518
This one has been running for two
hours without breaking a sweat.

853
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,315
That's incredible, if I...

854
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:29,158
They can survive on 30 calories a day and
half of sleep a week. They are always happy.

855
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:33,471
And they can rewire a carbonetrix
core in under two minutes.

856
01:12:33,971 --> 01:12:36,651
But will she be ready
for the new colony?

857
01:12:37,404 --> 01:12:39,404
Sire, they're here.

858
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,041
Here we go.

859
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:58,518
- We're here to see...
- The High Evolutionary's expecting you.

860
01:12:58,543 --> 01:13:00,190
Which means it is a trap.

861
01:13:00,215 --> 01:13:01,448
It's a face-off.

862
01:13:01,473 --> 01:13:02,994
She stays here.

863
01:13:03,019 --> 01:13:05,041
- Why?
- Policy against weaponry.

864
01:13:05,066 --> 01:13:07,066
And your arm is a gun.

865
01:13:11,411 --> 01:13:13,276
- He's clean.
- Let's go.

866
01:13:13,778 --> 01:13:14,783
Hey.

867
01:13:16,044 --> 01:13:17,135
It'll be okay.

868
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:39,389
Move it!

869
01:13:58,802 --> 01:14:00,802
Are you okay, Rocket?

870
01:14:18,499 --> 01:14:20,149
Me and Rocket play now?

871
01:14:20,174 --> 01:14:21,595
I can't right now, Floor.

872
01:14:28,913 --> 01:14:31,485
- What are you doing?
- They ain't gonna set us free.

873
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:35,970
Yes they are, Rocket. We're going
to the new world any day now.

874
01:14:39,262 --> 01:14:40,712
No, that can't be true.

875
01:14:40,763 --> 01:14:41,876
It is.

876
01:14:42,623 --> 01:14:44,623
They wanna kill
us all in the morning.

877
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:46,259
- What?
- What?

878
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:48,949
But I'm gonna fix it.

879
01:14:54,172 --> 01:14:55,376
What is that?

880
01:14:55,444 --> 01:14:56,673
It's a key.

881
01:14:57,442 --> 01:14:59,442
I'm gonna use it to
get us all outta here.

882
01:15:00,558 --> 01:15:02,558
I don't know if
that's wise, Rocket.

883
01:15:03,742 --> 01:15:08,007
Me, Rocket, leave!
Hurray, friends forever!

884
01:15:08,411 --> 01:15:09,899
Just down that hall,

885
01:15:10,097 --> 01:15:11,376
there's ships.

886
01:15:12,088 --> 01:15:15,970
I know that if we can
get to one, I can pilot it.

887
01:15:16,509 --> 01:15:18,657
And then we'll all
fly away together.

888
01:15:18,959 --> 01:15:22,399
The four of us, just like
we always said, okay?

889
01:15:24,818 --> 01:15:26,003
Okay?

890
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:34,024
Woohoo! Yippee, Rocket!
Sky, sky, sky!

891
01:15:56,706 --> 01:15:57,982
You did it!

892
01:15:58,029 --> 01:16:01,545
You did it!

893
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,001
You did it!

894
01:16:27,806 --> 01:16:29,181
It really is good to have---

895
01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:49,214
Yes, I imagined you'd
do something like this.

896
01:16:50,245 --> 01:16:51,988
Back in the cage, P13.

897
01:16:58,118 --> 01:16:59,519
Sky...

898
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:17,339
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

899
01:17:17,387 --> 01:17:21,238
Q12 and P13 escaped
from their pens.

900
01:17:21,398 --> 01:17:23,745
Q12 is neutralized, but...

901
01:17:23,878 --> 01:17:25,355
P13 is still out,

902
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:27,277
so I'll need assistance.

903
01:17:27,567 --> 01:17:29,183
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

904
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:30,589
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

905
01:17:30,614 --> 01:17:32,581
Remember, not
to bruise its brain.

906
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,072
Alright, P13!

907
01:17:42,097 --> 01:17:45,003
You win the crying contest,
now back in the cage!

908
01:17:48,522 --> 01:17:50,286
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

909
01:17:50,611 --> 01:17:52,988
Just go! Rocket, please!

910
01:17:53,016 --> 01:17:55,214
Rocket! Rocket!

911
01:17:57,637 --> 01:17:59,637
Down here, hurry!

912
01:19:46,065 --> 01:19:47,300
What are you doing?

913
01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:48,831
I have a bad feeling about this.

914
01:19:48,856 --> 01:19:50,682
Peter just told you to stay here.

915
01:19:50,714 --> 01:19:51,940
Yeah well, that's his fault.

916
01:19:51,965 --> 01:19:54,901
He should know by now that I never
do anything that anyone ever tells me.

917
01:19:55,263 --> 01:19:57,073
We need to protect Rocket.

918
01:19:57,399 --> 01:19:58,925
Yeah, that's right.

919
01:19:59,345 --> 01:20:02,011
So hop on. And we'll
ride back to the ship.

920
01:20:02,036 --> 01:20:03,690
Just right over there?

921
01:20:04,491 --> 01:20:05,534
Yeah.

922
01:20:15,957 --> 01:20:19,286
Drax! Hey, stop being a jerk.

923
01:20:28,011 --> 01:20:31,137
You! Hey! Yeah, you.

924
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:35,254
I take it the pass key, it's in
that thing on your head.

925
01:20:35,441 --> 01:20:37,441
I would advise
against aggression.

926
01:20:38,209 --> 01:20:40,340
Oh, got time for me now?

927
01:20:40,746 --> 01:20:43,715
Your friend once took advantage.

928
01:20:44,181 --> 01:20:45,691
I learned my lessons.

929
01:20:46,029 --> 01:20:51,613
I aimed some small part of my mental
capacity back in my own direction.

930
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:55,723
And now, gravity itself
serves my whims.

931
01:20:56,294 --> 01:20:58,566
War Pig, now.

932
01:21:02,075 --> 01:21:04,434
You must find Counter-Earth familiar.

933
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:07,676
- Counter-Earth.
- I visited your planet many years ago.

934
01:21:07,701 --> 01:21:09,504
Earth hasn't been my
planet in a long time.

935
01:21:09,529 --> 01:21:10,707
Your people had...

936
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:12,676
Wonderful spirit.

937
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,473
The art, music and literature,

938
01:21:15,498 --> 01:21:17,457
were some of the
finest in the universe.

939
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:23,198
Earth would be a fabulous place were
it not for the ignorance and bigotry.

940
01:21:23,224 --> 01:21:25,738
- Okay.
- It inspired me to create Counter-Earth.

941
01:21:25,763 --> 01:21:28,645
- I don't care...
- All of the good and none of the bad.

942
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:31,652
I don't need another speech
by some impotent whackjob

943
01:21:31,677 --> 01:21:35,566
whose mother didn't love him, rationalizing
why he needs to conquer the universe.

944
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,176
I'm not trying to
conquer the universe...

945
01:21:39,271 --> 01:21:40,605
I'm perfecting it.

946
01:21:46,417 --> 01:21:47,910
What the...

947
01:22:07,295 --> 01:22:08,332
Hey!

948
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,488
Drop the badger.

949
01:22:14,902 --> 01:22:16,176
I just want the pass key.

950
01:22:16,201 --> 01:22:18,574
Then bring me 89P13.

951
01:22:18,599 --> 01:22:20,090
I am Groot.

952
01:22:20,351 --> 01:22:22,176
He says suck my---

953
01:22:22,201 --> 01:22:23,793
Why are you so angry?

954
01:22:23,818 --> 01:22:25,818
Because I know what
you did to our friend.

955
01:22:26,254 --> 01:22:29,355
Anything I've done, I've done for
the betterment of the universe.

956
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:36,281
Newsflash, Einstein. Better universe generally don't include
a bunch of octopuses selling meth to guys with cockroach heads.

957
01:22:37,316 --> 01:22:38,504
They do not.

958
01:22:40,892 --> 01:22:44,332
Which is why, as I've
done many times before...

959
01:22:44,606 --> 01:22:46,915
I'm going to have to raze it all,

960
01:22:47,105 --> 01:22:48,535
and start again.

961
01:22:58,137 --> 01:23:01,621
I got 89P13 and
I'm on my way.

962
01:23:01,646 --> 01:23:03,090
We're in possession of the subject.

963
01:23:29,499 --> 01:23:30,890
Oh, my God.

964
01:23:41,548 --> 01:23:42,968
I am Groot?

965
01:23:43,073 --> 01:23:44,116
Kill them all.

966
01:23:47,312 --> 01:23:48,648
Stay.

967
01:23:49,779 --> 01:23:51,398
I said stay.

968
01:23:52,693 --> 01:23:55,632
What? Did you want me to leave you
back so that mother could pull at you?

969
01:23:56,481 --> 01:23:57,575
Stay.

970
01:23:57,864 --> 01:24:01,273
What the hell, we're working
for the same boss.

971
01:24:01,298 --> 01:24:05,546
Yes, but I need the credit, chum.
To save my entire civilization.

972
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:09,398
So be a good creepy... thing,

973
01:24:09,609 --> 01:24:10,710
and back off.

974
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:21,385
Oh.

975
01:25:01,681 --> 01:25:03,055
Mother.

976
01:25:27,101 --> 01:25:28,263
Mother!

977
01:25:33,651 --> 01:25:35,232
Mantis, Drax, come in.

978
01:25:35,646 --> 01:25:37,646
Mantis, Drax?

979
01:25:38,365 --> 01:25:41,349
- Uh, hey.
- I need you to bring the ship here, now!

980
01:25:41,374 --> 01:25:44,013
Well, we can't do that exactly, because...

981
01:25:44,665 --> 01:25:45,857
We're not in the ship.

982
01:25:45,882 --> 01:25:47,287
Then where the hell are you?

983
01:26:16,066 --> 01:26:17,673
- Nebula, come in.
- Gamora!

984
01:26:17,698 --> 01:26:20,923
Take off now! Get yourself
and Rocket off the planet!

985
01:26:26,137 --> 01:26:27,567
What kind of ship is this?

986
01:26:31,043 --> 01:26:32,614
That's amusing, really.

987
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:34,340
How stupid are you?

988
01:26:34,365 --> 01:26:36,200
It was so obviously a trap.

989
01:26:36,287 --> 01:26:39,059
It's not a trap, it's a face-off!

990
01:26:39,517 --> 01:26:41,387
Now, kill them all.

991
01:26:47,784 --> 01:26:48,785
Grenade!

992
01:27:27,002 --> 01:27:30,556
I am Groot!

993
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:05,850
No, no, no, please.

994
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:08,413
*

995
01:28:12,563 --> 01:28:15,163
Thank you, thank you.

996
01:28:15,551 --> 01:28:16,952
That would be premature.

997
01:28:17,074 --> 01:28:18,835
Huh? No, no, no, no!

998
01:28:30,277 --> 01:28:32,277
Quite a novel escape plan.

999
01:28:32,358 --> 01:28:34,925
Jumping headfirst into
an exploding planet.

1000
01:28:39,733 --> 01:28:41,472
You'll kill us both!

1001
01:28:41,497 --> 01:28:43,128
Not both!

1002
01:28:59,011 --> 01:29:00,153
Why are we doing this?

1003
01:29:00,178 --> 01:29:03,192
Quill and Groot are inside!
We have to get them out.

1004
01:29:32,141 --> 01:29:33,281
Groot.

1005
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:51,679
Whoever's in the cockpit,
activate the brake.

1006
01:29:51,704 --> 01:29:53,672
The steering mechanism is stuck!

1007
01:29:53,697 --> 01:29:55,195
Well, pull harder!

1008
01:30:00,879 --> 01:30:02,448
Let's go!

1009
01:30:22,712 --> 01:30:24,712
It's hard to breathe.

1010
01:30:31,602 --> 01:30:33,602
We are entering space.

1011
01:31:00,093 --> 01:31:01,387
Oh, piss off.

1012
01:31:10,457 --> 01:31:13,215
What kind of monster
slaughters a civilization?

1013
01:31:13,664 --> 01:31:15,664
- Where are Mantis and Drax?
- I do not know!

1014
01:31:23,927 --> 01:31:25,506
You're lucky I was able
to knock down that door.

1015
01:31:25,531 --> 01:31:28,413
Rocket and Gamora, are
probably dead because of you!

1016
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:30,374
- I didn't know.
- Oh, you didn't know?

1017
01:31:30,399 --> 01:31:33,701
When are you gonna stop using the
excuse of being some big dumb clown

1018
01:31:33,726 --> 01:31:37,285
for contributing nothing, and the
rest of us having to carry your slack!

1019
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:40,054
Don't push him! You don't have
the right to push him.

1020
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:41,917
And you, you're no better.

1021
01:31:41,942 --> 01:31:46,855
The only thing we can count on you for, is when someone
shows weakness, you'll be right there to support it.

1022
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,316
Fine, I don't care.

1023
01:31:48,341 --> 01:31:51,894
I know you need to find fault in everyone
else to make yourself feel okay.

1024
01:31:52,108 --> 01:31:53,261
So find it in me.

1025
01:31:53,286 --> 01:31:54,800
Go to hell, Mant!

1026
01:31:54,825 --> 01:31:56,825
But you don't have
the right to push him!

1027
01:31:57,142 --> 01:31:58,957
It's not his fault he's stupid.

1028
01:31:59,448 --> 01:32:00,449
He's a liability.

1029
01:32:00,474 --> 01:32:04,871
He makes us laugh and he loves
us. How is that a liability?

1030
01:32:05,188 --> 01:32:08,746
All you care about is
intelligence and competence.

1031
01:32:08,771 --> 01:32:10,793
Not sure I appreciate this defense.

1032
01:32:10,818 --> 01:32:12,347
He has sadness...

1033
01:32:12,435 --> 01:32:15,308
But he's the only one of you
who doesn't hate himself.

1034
01:32:15,723 --> 01:32:17,535
I don't care if he's stupid.

1035
01:32:18,261 --> 01:32:19,754
Do you think I'm stupid?

1036
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:22,160
Yes.

1037
01:32:25,923 --> 01:32:27,144
Forget.

1038
01:32:29,913 --> 01:32:33,086
Hah! You're lucky I was able to knock
down that door with my incredible strength.

1039
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:34,977
Quill?

1040
01:32:35,532 --> 01:32:37,391
Quill, are you there?

1041
01:32:41,475 --> 01:32:43,805
This language isn't in my translator.

1042
01:33:17,818 --> 01:33:18,969
Okay.

1043
01:33:19,221 --> 01:33:21,157
Alright, Rocket. Go.

1044
01:33:38,665 --> 01:33:39,914
Lylla?

1045
01:33:42,565 --> 01:33:44,211
Friend.

1046
01:33:47,007 --> 01:33:48,836
Okay. Okay...

1047
01:33:48,861 --> 01:33:50,219
Okay, here we go.

1048
01:33:53,614 --> 01:33:55,078
This isn't right.

1049
01:33:55,561 --> 01:33:57,813
No, no, no. It's good.
It's gonna work. It's working.

1050
01:33:57,838 --> 01:33:59,243
It needs to be faster.

1051
01:34:01,766 --> 01:34:04,618
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1052
01:34:06,802 --> 01:34:09,430
- Rocket.
- I let you down.

1053
01:34:10,002 --> 01:34:11,500
I got you killed.

1054
01:34:14,146 --> 01:34:15,664
You were right.

1055
01:34:16,196 --> 01:34:18,110
The sky is beautiful.

1056
01:34:18,135 --> 01:34:19,625
And it is forever.

1057
01:34:20,366 --> 01:34:23,289
And I've been flying
with our friends.

1058
01:34:36,627 --> 01:34:38,328
Can I come?

1059
01:34:38,453 --> 01:34:39,531
Yes.

1060
01:34:49,259 --> 01:34:50,446
No, no, no, no.

1061
01:34:50,743 --> 01:34:51,750
No!

1062
01:34:53,673 --> 01:34:55,321
- Come on!
- Quill.

1063
01:34:58,149 --> 01:34:59,578
No!

1064
01:34:59,674 --> 01:35:01,674
No!

1065
01:35:04,175 --> 01:35:05,633
- Quill...
- No!

1066
01:35:06,589 --> 01:35:08,797
- I'm not gonna lose him.
- He is gone.

1067
01:35:08,822 --> 01:35:11,797
I'm not letting him go!

1068
01:35:27,739 --> 01:35:28,977
But not yet.

1069
01:35:30,245 --> 01:35:32,649
You still have a purpose here.

1070
01:35:32,881 --> 01:35:34,243
A purpose for what?

1071
01:35:35,010 --> 01:35:36,610
They made us for nothing!

1072
01:35:36,744 --> 01:35:39,727
Just a bunch of experiments
to be thrown away!

1073
01:35:40,344 --> 01:35:42,344
There are the hands that made us...

1074
01:35:42,493 --> 01:35:45,266
and then there are the
hands that guide the hands.

1075
01:35:52,648 --> 01:35:54,648
My beloved raccoon...

1076
01:35:55,444 --> 01:35:59,437
This story has been yours
all along. You just didn't know it.

1077
01:36:03,274 --> 01:36:04,526
I'm not a raccoon.

1078
01:36:12,268 --> 01:36:13,666
The pass key's coming through!

1079
01:36:51,733 --> 01:36:53,010
Where's Nebula?

1080
01:36:59,053 --> 01:37:00,708
She, she's, uh....

1081
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:03,482
'Cause her call's on
the comm behind you.

1082
01:37:09,837 --> 01:37:11,406
- What... Nebula?
- Where are you?

1083
01:37:11,431 --> 01:37:13,865
- Oh, thank God!
- We're here to get you out of here.

1084
01:37:14,017 --> 01:37:15,594
- Out of where?
- The High Evolutionary's ship!

1085
01:37:15,619 --> 01:37:16,812
No, I got off the ship.

1086
01:37:17,169 --> 01:37:18,703
- You what?
- Wait, where are you?

1087
01:37:18,751 --> 01:37:19,906
On the ship!

1088
01:37:19,931 --> 01:37:21,461
- On the ship?!
- I didn't lie.

1089
01:37:21,486 --> 01:37:24,351
- Why are you on the ship?
- To save you, obviously!

1090
01:37:24,376 --> 01:37:28,695
No, I told you to go back. You gotta know by now I
always figure out a clever way to get out of a fix!

1091
01:37:28,811 --> 01:37:30,811
- Tell him I said hi.
- Really?

1092
01:37:30,916 --> 01:37:32,476
Tell him we're coming to save him.

1093
01:37:32,501 --> 01:37:35,703
Pay attention or play with
the kids. One or the other.

1094
01:37:35,728 --> 01:37:38,234
- Play with the kids?
- How did you get out?

1095
01:37:38,259 --> 01:37:40,672
- That's not really important...
- I am Groot.

1096
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,819
Jumping a 1000 feet to your death without a
parachute is a clever way of getting out of a fix?

1097
01:37:46,363 --> 01:37:48,476
You're only just making up
stuff that he's saying, right?

1098
01:37:48,742 --> 01:37:51,164
The important thing
is we're all okay.

1099
01:37:54,764 --> 01:37:55,781
Rocket?

1100
01:37:56,744 --> 01:37:59,976
Yes, he's here and he's okay.

1101
01:38:05,706 --> 01:38:09,695
Rocket, we love you very much
and we're happy you're alive.

1102
01:38:10,441 --> 01:38:12,101
Well that makes you idiots, then.

1103
01:38:12,142 --> 01:38:14,142
He's right about that.

1104
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:16,969
Back in your cages!

1105
01:38:21,103 --> 01:38:22,328
Nebula?

1106
01:38:23,349 --> 01:38:24,844
Nebula, come in.

1107
01:38:30,455 --> 01:38:33,703
So, you'd like to joust, would you?

1108
01:38:35,646 --> 01:38:37,797
Go to hell, you sick
son of a bitch.

1109
01:38:37,948 --> 01:38:39,500
You killed all of those people.

1110
01:38:39,525 --> 01:38:41,211
As I will your friends.

1111
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:43,900
I'm sending you the coordinates.

1112
01:38:44,149 --> 01:38:47,648
They will die unless you
bring me what is mine!

1113
01:38:47,673 --> 01:38:55,945
Screw you, you stretch-faced, Robocop looking,
Skeletor wannabe, purple-nurple, piece of---

1114
01:38:58,783 --> 01:38:59,859
He hung up.

1115
01:39:02,726 --> 01:39:03,820
You think?

1116
01:39:07,079 --> 01:39:08,867
1966...

1117
01:39:08,991 --> 01:39:11,186
The Soviets put me on a rocket

1118
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:16,844
knowing full well I never to return
and I will die in a fiery ball of death.

1119
01:39:16,947 --> 01:39:19,914
The one thing even Soviets never do,

1120
01:39:19,939 --> 01:39:22,055
is call me "bad dog."

1121
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:24,547
Oh, my God, just let it go.

1122
01:39:24,572 --> 01:39:27,414
Kraglin, please, just take it back.

1123
01:39:27,439 --> 01:39:28,820
This is killing us.

1124
01:39:28,845 --> 01:39:33,156
I can't take it back if she
is, in fact, a bad dog.

1125
01:39:33,892 --> 01:39:36,414
It never stops hurting.

1126
01:39:37,093 --> 01:39:40,016
- Kraglin.
- Oh, hey, Pete.

1127
01:39:40,123 --> 01:39:42,351
We need to save
Nebula, Mantis and Drax,

1128
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:43,937
and we need your help.

1129
01:39:43,962 --> 01:39:45,125
Me?

1130
01:39:48,647 --> 01:39:50,647
You're the one who
lost him, you twit!

1131
01:39:50,672 --> 01:39:52,555
The hellspawn heard it, sire.

1132
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:55,422
- But...
- But, but, but, but, but!

1133
01:39:57,027 --> 01:39:58,953
That rancid word.

1134
01:40:01,899 --> 01:40:04,219
I'm merely wondering
whether it might be wiser,

1135
01:40:04,244 --> 01:40:07,773
to go directly to the new colony and
not engage in unnecessary conflict.

1136
01:40:07,798 --> 01:40:11,641
They can rewire a carbonetrix
core in under two minutes.

1137
01:40:11,666 --> 01:40:13,312
But what is that, Vim?

1138
01:40:14,073 --> 01:40:16,961
- Rote memorization.
- Rote memorization!

1139
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:22,570
In hundreds of years of our creations,
only one has known true invention.

1140
01:40:22,936 --> 01:40:23,969
One.

1141
01:40:25,667 --> 01:40:27,667
Putrid in every other way,

1142
01:40:27,753 --> 01:40:30,617
but 89P13 had that.

1143
01:40:33,437 --> 01:40:34,664
Yes, sire.

1144
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:38,265
A populace unable to think,

1145
01:40:38,334 --> 01:40:40,771
what hasn't yet been thought, will die.

1146
01:40:40,853 --> 01:40:44,922
And why we need 89P13's brain

1147
01:40:44,947 --> 01:40:48,523
so we can transfer that
trait into these creatures

1148
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,655
before we go to the new colony.

1149
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,508
Nothing else matters.

1150
01:41:12,737 --> 01:41:14,393
How did they get down here?

1151
01:41:17,239 --> 01:41:19,768
Peter will be trying to
get to the spaceport.

1152
01:41:19,993 --> 01:41:21,768
He doesn't know about the children.

1153
01:41:22,078 --> 01:41:23,206
You!

1154
01:41:24,221 --> 01:41:29,081
We need you to let all the other children onboard
know to stay away from the starboard walls!

1155
01:41:31,615 --> 01:41:34,135
They know three freaking words
and two of them are joob.

1156
01:41:35,369 --> 01:41:37,369
No! Listen to me.

1157
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:40,409
You need to talk
to the other children.

1158
01:41:40,506 --> 01:41:43,260
All of them here, and tell them,

1159
01:41:43,285 --> 01:41:45,285
to stay away, from the freakin'----

1160
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:46,948
What the hell are you
doing, Mantis?

1161
01:41:46,973 --> 01:41:49,706
Explaining it, dickhead!

1162
01:42:00,588 --> 01:42:01,854
You're scaring them.

1163
01:42:08,024 --> 01:42:09,385
Hello, dumb idiots.

1164
01:42:13,879 --> 01:42:15,879
I had a little girl like you.

1165
01:42:15,904 --> 01:42:17,276
You know what she used to like?

1166
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:20,432
She liked when I
made monkey noises.

1167
01:42:30,869 --> 01:42:32,245
How is that a monkey?

1168
01:42:33,155 --> 01:42:34,354
Beats me.

1169
01:43:15,879 --> 01:43:18,204
They're gonna tell the other kids to stay
away from the starboard wall.

1170
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:21,352
Why didn't you tell us you knew
their language this whole time?

1171
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,867
Why didn't you ask?

1172
01:43:25,317 --> 01:43:27,317
This could be futile, Quill.

1173
01:43:27,542 --> 01:43:28,985
He's too powerful.

1174
01:43:29,086 --> 01:43:30,719
Well then, I guess we'll die trying.

1175
01:43:31,028 --> 01:43:33,321
What is dying trying gonna accomplish?

1176
01:43:33,626 --> 01:43:35,329
Or we can just give
him the badger.

1177
01:43:35,354 --> 01:43:37,766
Our thing, is dying trying.

1178
01:43:37,921 --> 01:43:39,274
I am Groot.

1179
01:43:39,299 --> 01:43:41,299
I know who you are already!

1180
01:43:41,324 --> 01:43:43,563
Feel free to stay
behind in the cargo area.

1181
01:43:43,727 --> 01:43:46,188
I'm not leaving my
sister with that jackass.

1182
01:43:46,664 --> 01:43:47,923
This you?

1183
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:49,688
Fell out of your bag.

1184
01:43:52,113 --> 01:43:53,469
Let's do this.

1185
01:44:29,893 --> 01:44:31,306
Wait...

1186
01:44:33,099 --> 01:44:34,376
Wait...

1187
01:44:40,183 --> 01:44:42,275
You almost have to
admire their pluck.

1188
01:44:43,482 --> 01:44:44,523
Sire.

1189
01:44:55,525 --> 01:44:57,525
Howdy there, you freakin' creep.

1190
01:45:02,047 --> 01:45:03,870
- Back up!
- Yes, sire.

1191
01:45:06,235 --> 01:45:07,589
You're on, Steemie.

1192
01:45:08,403 --> 01:45:10,308
First barrel.

1193
01:45:11,399 --> 01:45:13,050
Second barrel.

1194
01:45:13,702 --> 01:45:15,269
Third barrel.

1195
01:45:15,294 --> 01:45:16,503
Fourth barrel.

1196
01:45:24,987 --> 01:45:26,987
Hard starboard.

1197
01:45:27,012 --> 01:45:28,417
Hard starboard.

1198
01:45:33,847 --> 01:45:35,386
And, fire!

1199
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:45,351
They've breached the spaceport.

1200
01:45:45,376 --> 01:45:47,984
One of them holds subject 89P13.

1201
01:45:48,009 --> 01:45:49,788
Release the hellspawn, all of them.

1202
01:45:49,813 --> 01:45:52,616
Sire, the hellspawn were created
solely to defend the new colony.

1203
01:45:52,641 --> 01:45:54,015
Do it now!

1204
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,960
Get me 89P13,

1205
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,424
and kill everyone in the
head of that dead god!

1206
01:46:37,463 --> 01:46:40,800
Spaceport wide open, Cap'n, but
that armaments was all we had.

1207
01:46:40,825 --> 01:46:43,011
Rocket, Groot, go, go!

1208
01:46:43,036 --> 01:46:44,355
Get inside that spaceport.

1209
01:46:58,203 --> 01:46:59,496
What the hell?

1210
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,368
Aww, come on!

1211
01:47:45,267 --> 01:47:47,852
Kraglin, we have been infiltrated!

1212
01:47:50,003 --> 01:47:51,274
Open the pit.

1213
01:47:51,299 --> 01:47:53,892
Sire, our bargaining
power will be gone.

1214
01:48:19,208 --> 01:48:20,434
Abilisks!

1215
01:48:27,622 --> 01:48:29,130
Good God...

1216
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,716
This way!

1217
01:49:42,705 --> 01:49:45,002
One more step and
this weird thing gets it!

1218
01:49:45,027 --> 01:49:46,315
Don't be rash.

1219
01:50:04,805 --> 01:50:06,125
What were you programming?

1220
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:07,500
Self-destruction code.

1221
01:50:25,366 --> 01:50:26,554
What are you doing?

1222
01:50:29,903 --> 01:50:31,054
It's okay.

1223
01:50:31,079 --> 01:50:32,569
Mantis, stop.

1224
01:50:34,576 --> 01:50:37,162
They eat batteries, not people.

1225
01:50:38,767 --> 01:50:42,249
Maybe they're just scared of
what we are gonna do to them.

1226
01:50:48,842 --> 01:50:50,554
We're not gonna hurt you.

1227
01:50:53,652 --> 01:50:55,652
Everything is going to be okay.

1228
01:51:51,463 --> 01:51:53,463
Use your heart, boy.

1229
01:52:43,826 --> 01:52:45,391
A dog?

1230
01:52:45,416 --> 01:52:46,437
Yeah.

1231
01:52:54,925 --> 01:52:56,602
She's a good dog.

1232
01:53:01,174 --> 01:53:03,628
I knew you believe
I'm good dog.

1233
01:53:03,653 --> 01:53:05,653
Alright, alright,
alright. Get off me.

1234
01:53:09,003 --> 01:53:12,182
Sire, we must retreat.
The ship is going down.

1235
01:53:12,207 --> 01:53:14,096
The spaceport has intruders.

1236
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:16,807
Go, see if one of them is 89P13.

1237
01:53:16,832 --> 01:53:19,120
Sire, you have an irrational
obsession with this animal.

1238
01:53:19,145 --> 01:53:20,737
You must stop
for God's sake---

1239
01:53:20,762 --> 01:53:24,784
There is no god!
That's why I stepped in!

1240
01:53:53,115 --> 01:53:57,638
Controller, I am taking
command of the Arete.

1241
01:53:57,809 --> 01:54:02,069
Disengage all damaged
sectors of the ship.

1242
01:54:02,689 --> 01:54:04,179
And retreat...

1243
01:54:29,489 --> 01:54:30,708
Attention,

1244
01:54:30,733 --> 01:54:32,083
all personnel...

1245
01:54:32,983 --> 01:54:36,260
Intruders have boarded the ship.

1246
01:54:36,917 --> 01:54:40,130
Head to the starboard spaceport.

1247
01:54:41,663 --> 01:54:44,292
Bring me 89P13.

1248
01:54:45,485 --> 01:54:47,232
And kill the rest.

1249
01:54:56,507 --> 01:54:59,576
We go in there, we get
Mantis, Nebula and Drax.

1250
01:54:59,728 --> 01:55:02,673
We move in, we get
them, and get out.

1251
01:55:22,066 --> 01:55:23,635
Did that look cool?

1252
01:55:24,229 --> 01:55:25,169
Okay.

1253
01:55:25,194 --> 01:55:27,818
New gameplan. We get
the hell outta here now.

1254
01:55:28,090 --> 01:55:29,771
There are thousands of
creatures on this ship.

1255
01:55:29,796 --> 01:55:32,719
- Many of them are children.
- We need to be good joob-joob.

1256
01:55:32,885 --> 01:55:35,268
- Huh?
- It means friends.

1257
01:55:36,227 --> 01:55:39,118
If we want to live,
we have to leave now.

1258
01:55:39,143 --> 01:55:41,511
This whole rig is gonna
go down any second.

1259
01:55:41,672 --> 01:55:44,104
They will all die, if
we don't help them.

1260
01:55:51,152 --> 01:55:52,733
I'm done runnin'.

1261
01:58:56,044 --> 01:58:57,607
There's a big hole
up in the deck.

1262
01:58:57,632 --> 01:59:00,828
If we can connect that to Knowhere,
we can lead the survivors to safety.

1263
01:59:01,062 --> 01:59:02,742
Nebs and me
will pilot the ship.

1264
01:59:02,767 --> 01:59:05,078
You guys save all
the higher life forms.

1265
01:59:15,378 --> 01:59:16,416
Hello, moron.

1266
01:59:19,522 --> 01:59:20,542
Come on!

1267
01:59:22,432 --> 01:59:23,994
Follow me, come on!

1268
01:59:25,296 --> 01:59:26,466
Come on!

1269
01:59:27,471 --> 01:59:28,831
Go, go, go!

1270
01:59:30,513 --> 01:59:31,771
I am Groot.

1271
01:59:49,699 --> 01:59:51,356
Um, this way to...

1272
01:59:51,872 --> 01:59:53,053
Thank you.

1273
01:59:53,078 --> 01:59:54,616
Yes, you're welcome.

1274
01:59:54,641 --> 01:59:57,485
I was screaming at something
scary behind you. Not you.

1275
01:59:57,524 --> 01:59:59,240
You look really cool.

1276
02:00:04,637 --> 02:00:06,889
Kill me if you want, but then
good luck getting out of here.

1277
02:00:11,070 --> 02:00:13,272
Let him go. That guy's
our only chance.

1278
02:00:13,326 --> 02:00:17,277
I got a space big enough to get through. I gotta
find out if I can change it to a permeable shield.

1279
02:00:23,846 --> 02:00:27,321
I can't fly this freakin' thing. The
controls are all screwed.

1280
02:00:27,371 --> 02:00:28,464
I'll do it.

1281
02:00:28,627 --> 02:00:31,227
Go help the others. Wait,
give me your comm.

1282
02:00:39,084 --> 02:00:41,845
Kraglin, I'll pilot
from this side.

1283
02:00:42,927 --> 02:00:45,083
Nebula, back in action.

1284
02:01:11,817 --> 02:01:13,280
Come on, come on, come on!

1285
02:01:13,494 --> 02:01:15,744
Go, go!
Go, go, go!

1286
02:01:17,729 --> 02:01:19,629
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

1287
02:01:20,166 --> 02:01:21,170
Are those kids?

1288
02:01:38,493 --> 02:01:40,001
Okay, Cosmo, stitch it up.

1289
02:01:40,026 --> 02:01:42,714
It needs to be airtight for
the kids to make it across!

1290
02:01:42,739 --> 02:01:44,270
Locking up, captain.

1291
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:54,543
Go, now, go.

1292
02:01:59,134 --> 02:02:00,701
One by one.
One by one.

1293
02:02:08,704 --> 02:02:10,807
Landing in, and headed down.

1294
02:02:17,428 --> 02:02:18,776
This way, this way.

1295
02:02:22,879 --> 02:02:23,932
Why?

1296
02:02:25,604 --> 02:02:28,314
Why are you doing this?
I tried to kill you.

1297
02:02:29,059 --> 02:02:31,333
I am Groot.

1298
02:02:32,015 --> 02:02:35,416
He says everyone
deserves a second chance.

1299
02:02:46,395 --> 02:02:48,853
You are so strong.

1300
02:02:52,113 --> 02:02:54,570
Come on! Why
are you so slow?

1301
02:02:56,596 --> 02:02:57,865
Where is Rocket?

1302
02:05:27,477 --> 02:05:28,571
No!

1303
02:05:29,755 --> 02:05:31,873
You thought you could escape me?

1304
02:05:32,553 --> 02:05:33,606
No!

1305
02:05:35,836 --> 02:05:39,835
You think you have some worth in
and of yourself without me?

1306
02:05:39,866 --> 02:05:41,106
No!

1307
02:05:42,250 --> 02:05:44,250
You are an abomination!

1308
02:05:44,285 --> 02:05:47,307
Nothing more than a step, on my path!

1309
02:05:47,332 --> 02:05:50,145
You freakish little monster!

1310
02:05:50,170 --> 02:05:52,843
How dare you think you are more?

1311
02:05:53,030 --> 02:05:56,998
8-9-P-1-3!

1312
02:06:00,292 --> 02:06:04,541
The name's Rocket.
Rocket Raccoon.

1313
02:06:44,988 --> 02:06:46,354
His face came off.

1314
02:06:46,789 --> 02:06:47,832
It's a mask.

1315
02:06:49,537 --> 02:06:51,537
Look what you did to me.

1316
02:06:52,589 --> 02:06:53,648
For what?

1317
02:06:54,265 --> 02:06:56,092
All I wanted to do...

1318
02:06:56,694 --> 02:06:59,863
was to make things perfect.

1319
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:03,173
You didn't want to
make things perfect.

1320
02:07:03,353 --> 02:07:05,928
You just hated things
the way they are.

1321
02:07:06,144 --> 02:07:07,149
Kill him.

1322
02:07:13,821 --> 02:07:14,855
Why?

1323
02:07:15,784 --> 02:07:18,648
Because I'm a freakin'
Guardian of the Galaxy.

1324
02:07:19,712 --> 02:07:21,972
We have to get
out of here, now.

1325
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:23,165
We have to save them

1326
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:24,607
We've got all the kids on board.

1327
02:07:24,632 --> 02:07:27,781
No, Pete. The
rest of them.

1328
02:07:33,825 --> 02:07:35,595
Come on! Come on, move.

1329
02:07:36,501 --> 02:07:37,527
Move it.

1330
02:07:37,653 --> 02:07:38,685
Whoa.

1331
02:07:44,583 --> 02:07:45,595
Come on.

1332
02:07:46,175 --> 02:07:47,726
Come on, come on.

1333
02:07:50,535 --> 02:07:53,344
I thought we were limiting ourselves
to the higher life forms.

1334
02:07:54,047 --> 02:07:55,055
Me, too.

1335
02:08:03,170 --> 02:08:05,342
Go babies. Go, babies.

1336
02:08:05,495 --> 02:08:07,131
Go!

1337
02:08:07,252 --> 02:08:09,496
I cannot hold... much...

1338
02:08:30,147 --> 02:08:31,377
Quill!

1339
02:08:31,402 --> 02:08:32,414
Hurry!

1340
02:09:15,079 --> 02:09:18,288
Peter!

1341
02:10:25,487 --> 02:10:26,559
Peter.

1342
02:10:31,868 --> 02:10:34,663
Did that...

1343
02:10:35,754 --> 02:10:36,950
... look cool?

1344
02:10:40,433 --> 02:10:41,509
Come on.

1345
02:10:53,665 --> 02:10:54,965
Cosmo.

1346
02:10:55,305 --> 02:10:56,534
I'm okay.

1347
02:11:34,127 --> 02:11:35,377
I am Groot.

1348
02:11:36,212 --> 02:11:38,893
Thanks, just tell them
I'm gonna be right...

1349
02:11:44,226 --> 02:11:45,470
I am Groot.

1350
02:11:47,379 --> 02:11:50,534
Yeah. It's good working
with you too.

1351
02:11:57,842 --> 02:12:00,662
Hey Gamora, are you ready?

1352
02:12:01,119 --> 02:12:02,153
Yeah.

1353
02:12:08,411 --> 02:12:10,411
You know I'm still not
who you want me to be.

1354
02:12:12,127 --> 02:12:13,147
I know.

1355
02:12:14,459 --> 02:12:16,287
But who you are ain't so bad.

1356
02:12:36,631 --> 02:12:37,991
I bet we were fun.

1357
02:12:43,511 --> 02:12:45,257
Like you wouldn't believe.

1358
02:12:52,046 --> 02:12:53,112
All right.

1359
02:13:06,627 --> 02:13:08,139
Are you okay?

1360
02:13:09,997 --> 02:13:11,997
I think I need to
talk to everybody.

1361
02:13:14,352 --> 02:13:16,352
So, you're gonna leave?

1362
02:13:18,219 --> 02:13:22,344
My mother died in front of me when I was 8
years old and I have been running ever since.

1363
02:13:23,616 --> 02:13:25,192
I'm gonna need to take some time.

1364
02:13:28,032 --> 02:13:29,155
Learn how to swim.

1365
02:13:32,114 --> 02:13:33,246
I as well.

1366
02:13:37,649 --> 02:13:39,119
I love you all.

1367
02:13:39,541 --> 02:13:40,625
I do.

1368
02:13:44,620 --> 02:13:48,175
But my whole life, I did
whatever Ego wanted.

1369
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:50,881
And then I did whatever
the Guardians wanted.

1370
02:13:51,915 --> 02:13:55,220
I need to go out and
discover what I want.

1371
02:13:55,373 --> 02:13:57,500
- I will come with you.
- No Drax.

1372
02:13:57,726 --> 02:13:58,970
That's the whole point.

1373
02:13:58,995 --> 02:14:00,483
But you need someone to protect you.

1374
02:14:00,508 --> 02:14:02,259
- I don't.
- Not in a bad way.

1375
02:14:02,471 --> 02:14:04,077
Just because of your
incredible weakness.

1376
02:14:04,102 --> 02:14:05,980
Oh, my God, you're so frustrating.

1377
02:14:06,005 --> 02:14:08,885
Drax, I need you here.

1378
02:14:09,558 --> 02:14:11,349
We're building a new society.

1379
02:14:11,619 --> 02:14:14,085
I need all the support I can get
for those children out there.

1380
02:14:15,448 --> 02:14:18,310
Today, I saw who you are.

1381
02:14:19,318 --> 02:14:21,129
You weren't born
to be a destroyer.

1382
02:14:23,035 --> 02:14:24,503
You were born
to be a dad.

1383
02:14:29,139 --> 02:14:30,966
So you'll lead the Guardians then?

1384
02:14:31,536 --> 02:14:32,578
No.

1385
02:14:33,078 --> 02:14:34,425
I'm going to lead the city.

1386
02:14:35,342 --> 02:14:36,989
Make it the type of
home I never had.

1387
02:14:39,887 --> 02:14:41,306
So that's it?

1388
02:14:42,726 --> 02:14:44,070
The group's over?

1389
02:14:44,583 --> 02:14:45,646
No.

1390
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:48,324
The galaxy still
needs its guardians.

1391
02:14:49,410 --> 02:14:52,124
And you, will make a better
leader than I ever was...

1392
02:14:53,278 --> 02:14:54,382
Captain.

1393
02:15:14,497 --> 02:15:16,264
I love you, guys.

1394
02:17:29,223 --> 02:17:30,703
Welcome home.

1395
02:18:18,953 --> 02:18:21,078
I think I might
be at the wrong...

1396
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:23,967
I'm looking for Jason Quill?

1397
02:18:23,992 --> 02:18:26,275
Yes. Come in.

1398
02:18:45,154 --> 02:18:46,326
Pete.

1399
02:18:58,072 --> 02:18:59,407
Hi, Grandpa.

Okay, how about your
favorite musical act?

1406
02:21:05,005 --> 02:21:06,126
Phyla, you first.

1407
02:21:07,728 --> 02:21:10,551
Britney Spears and Korn.

1408
02:21:10,977 --> 02:21:13,505
- Good choices.
- I gotta go with the man.

1409
02:21:13,699 --> 02:21:14,898
Garth Brooks.

1410
02:21:14,967 --> 02:21:17,966
The Carpenters did not
have a single bad song.

1411
02:21:18,223 --> 02:21:19,493
Adrian Belew.

1412
02:21:19,707 --> 02:21:22,895
Both solo, and his work
with King Crimson.

1413
02:21:23,859 --> 02:21:25,054
What about you, captain?

1414
02:21:25,129 --> 02:21:27,129
Oh, this one's kinda special.

1415
02:21:27,830 --> 02:21:30,701
♪ come and get your love ♪

1416
02:21:44,944 --> 02:21:46,408
Guess they're here.

1417
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:47,779
Well...

1418
02:21:48,652 --> 02:21:52,005
I can handle this by my lonesome
if you all wanna chill.

1419
02:21:52,614 --> 02:21:55,676
Nah, nah, it'll go fast if
we all do it together.

1420
02:21:56,165 --> 02:21:57,374
Groot, wake up.

1421
02:22:08,081 --> 02:22:10,081
Does anyone feel a
little sad for them?

1422
02:22:10,144 --> 02:22:13,670
Yeah, sure. But these townsfolk
can't protect themselves.

1423
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:15,474
On your word, Captain.

1424
02:22:25,774 --> 02:22:27,016
Word.

1425
02:28:52,696 --> 02:28:56,977
If she needs help mowing the lawn, I'll
do it but it kinda feel like her son's job.

1426
02:28:57,258 --> 02:28:59,578
Is she gonna sit on the
porch and watch me do it?

1427
02:28:59,656 --> 02:29:03,391
Like, a 45 year old man,
quietly mowing his lawn...

1428
02:29:03,462 --> 02:29:04,938
It just feels weird.

1429
02:29:04,977 --> 02:29:06,780
Don't get me started.

1430
02:29:08,210 --> 02:29:09,364
All right?

1431
02:29:10,750 --> 02:29:12,565
I kinda wanna know.
