00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:30,897
Come on, Drax, dance.

8
00:02:31,262 --> 00:02:32,760
Only idiots dance.

9
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:43,800
I'm a weirdo.

10
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:06,360
I wanna have control.

11
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:12,607
I want a perfect body...

12
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:49,004
Hey! Uh-uh!

13
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:56,962
I told you a million times, you keep your
grubby raccoon hands off my Zune!

14
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:02,109
I told you a million times,
I'm not a damn raccoon.

15
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:24,136
Again?

16
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,834
I love you, Gamora.

17
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,564
So what are you
gonna do about Quill?

18
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,413
Me? Why not you?

19
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,438
I got emotionalistical issues.

20
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:49,755
What am I gonna do?

21
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:51,105
Why are you on the ceiling?

22
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:54,116
I wanted to see if these new
gravity boots worked on a slope.

23
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,428
Here we go.

24
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:17,631
Sorry.

25
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,190
(Cosmo speaking Russian)

26
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:28,215
You must know you will never learn.

27
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,824
You could do better?

28
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:31,871
Dah.

29
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:33,925
*

30
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,657
Telekinesis is cheating!

31
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:55,532
That's a stupid little pebble.

32
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:57,557
I can do that with my dang finger.

33
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,945
You're a bad dog.

34
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,125
Do not say that to me.

35
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:03,875
You are. You're a bad dog.

36
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,931
Take that back. Come on,
that's not cool.

37
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:09,056
Nebula, did you hear?

38
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:12,259
He called me a bad dog and
he refuse to take it back.

39
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:13,954
I don't care, Cosmo.

40
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,587
Is Peter okay?

41
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,243
- I don't know.
- What are you going to do?

42
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:19,268
Me? He's your brother.

43
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:21,876
It doesn't matter, he still
doesn't listen to me.

44
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,829
Yeah, he has been pretty mopey
ever since Gamora died.

45
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,064
She's not dead.

46
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:28,860
She just doesn't remember
anything from the past few years.

47
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,196
Nobody tells me nothing.

48
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:33,446
Mantis, why don't you just touch him?
You know, make him happy.

49
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,540
I am Groot.

50
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:35,345
Gross!

51
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,564
No, not like that.
Touch him with her powers.

52
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,267
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

53
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,292
What about that time you made
me fall in love with my sock?

54
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:45,025
Well, that was funny.

55
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:47,532
I guess it's back to one of us
touching him the other way.

56
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,618
Maybe we should draw straws.

57
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:50,883
No one ever meant that, Drax.

58
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,654
What was that?!

59
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,162
What the hell?!

60
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:37,662
Where did you go, Squirrel?

61
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:46,820
On the ground!

62
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,524
Who is that maniac?

63
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:52,164
Some super-douche with ray gun hands!
I don't freakin' know.

64
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:31,569
Who threw this thing at me?

65
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:33,108
Shut up.

66
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:35,506
Baby.

67
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:53,304
Pick on someone your own size.

68
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:20,553
Peter!

69
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:22,443
Peter!

70
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:24,756
We need med packs.

71
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:39,882
Nebula.

72
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:41,187
Piss off!

73
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:28,936
That hurt.

74
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:30,709
What a pity.

75
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,825
No!

76
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:54,090
All I did was activate the med pack!

77
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:56,208
Get them off! Now!

78
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:40,739
Oh, hell.

79
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:43,333
- We need to get him to the med bay.
- It's destroyed.

80
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:44,684
There's one on the ship!

81
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,856
Stitch him up and transfer
him in with the rest of batch 89.

82
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:30,607
It's okay.

83
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:32,779
You're here with us now.

84
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:36,185
Hey, who's the new guy?

85
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,052
What kind of thing are you?

86
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:40,654
You've got like, a
mask on your face.

87
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:46,450
Mask, eyes, face, mouth.

88
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:48,224
Does it hurts?

89
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:50,630
It's okay, friend.

90
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:53,169
Don't let them scare you.

91
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:00,107
Hurts...

92
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:25,895
It's okay.

93
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:29,848
You're gonna be okay.

94
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:34,793
A kill switch?

95
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:36,043
A device.

96
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:38,785
Set to destruct if anyone goes
poking around inside him.

97
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,145
Or even if we use the med packs.

98
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,778
Why would a Rocket
have a kill switch?

99
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:46,442
Apparently someone considers him proprietary
technology and sent that golden lunatic to get him.

100
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,467
So he'll die if we operate on him?

101
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:50,848
- And he'll die if we don't.
- There has to be some way to bypass it.

102
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:53,496
It looks like there's a pass key
that can override the kill switch.

103
00:16:53,673 --> 00:16:55,942
What do we know about
where Rocket came from?

104
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:56,903
He won't talk about it.

105
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,754
Much of the tech was developed
by a company called Orgocorp.

106
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:01,559
And there's a code on all of it.

107
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:04,364
89P13.

108
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:06,629
He's got maybe 48 hours.

109
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:12,043
- Where are you going?
- Orgocorp had to have records, right?

110
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,020
Maybe it'll have a way for us to
override the kill switch and save Rocket.

111
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:16,660
They won't just give us that information.

112
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:18,254
Well, that's why we're gonna break in.

113
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,279
And kill anyone who gets in our way!

114
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:22,012
- Not kill anyone.
- Kill a few people.

115
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:25,660
- Kill no people.
- Kill one guy, one stupid guy who no one loves.

116
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:27,395
Now you're just making it sad.

117
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,558
Kraglin, Cosmo, I need you to keep watch over
Knowhere till we're back. Couple of days tops.

118
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:33,241
- Aye, cap'n.
- Aye, comrade.

119
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:37,321
- Take back what you said that I'm a bad dog.
- Nope.

120
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:40,121
I know you don't really
think that I'm a bad dog.

121
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:42,332
- Can you please take it back?
- I will not.

122
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,574
I located the coordinates of Orgocorp.

123
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,207
I think I have a contact near there.
Maybe they can help us get in.

124
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:50,817
Contact him.

125
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:52,942
Let's go save our friend.

126
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,182
It's good to have friends.

127
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,111
My poor baby.

128
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,478
Mama, it hurts.

129
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:14,658
- Do you have it?
- He does not, sire.

130
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:17,353
I tried to warn you,
High Evolutionary.

131
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:19,971
These Guardians are more
powerful than you think.

132
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:25,017
Or perhaps you simply overestimate
your own value, High Priestess.

133
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:28,377
No doubt, a flaw's on
top of my own design.

134
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:31,377
I created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment.

135
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:33,415
Beautiful numbskulls.

136
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,955
But your egos have
run wild. Say "ah."

137
00:19:38,198 --> 00:19:40,760
And this one was
meant to be the Warlock.

138
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,434
The apogee of their people.

139
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:46,041
You removed Adam from
his cocoon early, my liege.

140
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:47,619
He is still a child.

141
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,697
No, there's something wrong
with him even outside all that.

142
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:54,424
Yes, there's something wrong with me.
I was stabbed, you extraordinary phallus---

143
00:19:56,622 --> 00:19:58,978
He doesn't know any better. We
shall do whatever you require, my liege.

144
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:02,649
You knew of 89P13's existence
for years without alerting me.

145
00:20:02,674 --> 00:20:04,830
That's not what I require!

146
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:09,697
I'm sorry, my liege.

147
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:13,111
Find 89P13 and return it to me.

148
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:15,735
Or, I will destroy your entire civilization

149
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,354
as is my right as your maker!

150
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:20,158
Do you understand?

151
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:27,650
Do you understand?

152
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:29,675
Yes...

153
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:32,408
Toodle-loo.

154
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:38,072
How did 89P13 survive
after all these years, Theel?

155
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:39,588
It was always clever, sire.

156
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,613
Yes, that's exactly
why I want it now.

157
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:43,103
- Of course.
- Its brain.

158
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:45,494
That is the only reason, sire.

159
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:49,353
But are you really trusting
the Sovereign to retrieve it?

160
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:50,799
They're merely a backup.

161
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,840
I believe I know where they're going.

162
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:28,161
It's bioformed.

163
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:31,084
Instead of being built, it's
grown from living matter.

164
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:35,373
The structure is surrounded by three
impenetrable plasmic security shields.

165
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,919
It's not gonna be easy to
break into this place, Star-Lord.

166
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:41,216
Doesn't have to be easy. I was
a professional thief, remember?

167
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:43,403
I'll jam the signals one at a time.

168
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,747
She calls me Star-Lord
when she's mad at me.

169
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,552
She's always mad at everyone.

170
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:52,959
It's because I was drunk.

171
00:21:54,423 --> 00:21:57,771
She's right. If I haven't been drinking...

172
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,505
Maybe Rocket... I'm sorry.

173
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,896
It's okay, he's your best friend.

174
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,216
Second best friend.

175
00:22:04,264 --> 00:22:07,670
Everyone around me dies.
My mother, Yondu...

176
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:10,255
- Gamora...
- Gamora isn't dead.

177
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,420
She is to us.
Do you want a zargnut?

178
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:14,726
Thank you.

179
00:22:19,174 --> 00:22:20,287
First shield, set.

180
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:26,349
Three, two, one.

181
00:22:32,155 --> 00:22:33,685
- Peter.
- What?

182
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:37,547
You had family on Earth. And you
never wanted to go back and see them?

183
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:41,373
You're my sister. That's all
the family I want or need.

184
00:22:41,398 --> 00:22:44,529
Besides, it's probably just my grandpa,
okay? He was a pretty hard guy.

185
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:48,658
- Still, don't you think he...
- What?

186
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:52,404
You were abducted by Ravagers
the same day he lost his daughter.

187
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:56,505
Oh yeah, he was upset. My mom died, he screamed
at my face and he pushed me out of the room!

188
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,912
He was probably just trying to protect you.

189
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:00,700
- What are you talking about?
- What?

190
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:02,959
I'm talking about the people in my life who died,
and you're talking about this?

191
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:04,060
Second shield, set.

192
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:07,021
Three, two, one.

193
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:15,498
I'm only saying you've never
even gone to see if he's okay.

194
00:23:15,523 --> 00:23:16,990
He could still be alive.

195
00:23:17,015 --> 00:23:20,880
My grandpa? He'd be like, 90-
something years old.

196
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,505
So he could still be alive.

197
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,530
People on Earth die
when they're like 50.

198
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:26,154
They die when they're 50?

199
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:27,760
I don't know. Something like that.

200
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:29,545
What's even the
point of being born?

201
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,795
Exactly.

202
00:23:30,893 --> 00:23:32,893
Are you about to die?

203
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,138
I'm not 50!

204
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,834
The point is, I wasn't talking
about any of this.

205
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,849
Third shield, set.

206
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:47,302
Three, two, one.

207
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,826
Well, not everything is about
what you are talking about.

208
00:23:50,851 --> 00:23:55,904
And I'm only saying you're upset because so
many people you cared about have left you.

209
00:23:55,964 --> 00:23:57,964
But you also left someone.

210
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:00,552
And maybe I wanted a zargnut.

211
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,857
Too late. They're all gone.

212
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:16,787
Why didn't we go through?

213
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:22,701
We did. It's not the shield.

214
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:28,146
Oh, hell.

215
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,209
Ravagers.

216
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:37,005
Hey guys, you're about to be
boarded by the United Ravagers.

217
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:42,060
You can surrender and turn over any stuff
worth anything and live. Or you can die.

218
00:24:42,085 --> 00:24:43,826
It's up to you.

219
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:00,942
Drax, no, no, no! Drax!

220
00:25:00,988 --> 00:25:03,141
Guys, it's me. Peter Quill.
I'm one of you, remember?

221
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,305
Hold on!

222
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:06,491
- We have an appointment.
- We have an appointment.

223
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:07,929
- With who?
- With Gamora.

224
00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:10,147
With Gamora.
What?

225
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:11,858
You're early.

226
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:29,725
What are these?

227
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,750
Orgocorp uniforms.

228
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:37,092
You've got to wear these to move through
the Orgo without attracting attention.

229
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:39,019
This isn't my color.

230
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:43,485
What did you say?

231
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,510
It clashes with my eyes.

232
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,089
Put it on!

233
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:56,280
Nebula, why would you not tell me that
you've been in contact with Gamora?

234
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,827
Because I didn't want
you to get freaked out.

235
00:25:57,852 --> 00:26:00,218
- Freaked... out?!
- Like that.

236
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:03,663
*

237
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,413
Gamora, we're grateful for your help.

238
00:26:06,438 --> 00:26:08,546
I'm not doing this out of
the kindness of my heart.

239
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:12,233
I'm doing this for the hundred
thousand units my sister promised.

240
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:15,038
So you're a Ravager now?

241
00:26:15,978 --> 00:26:16,944
Put on the uniform.

242
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:18,969
Never pictured you as the Ravager type.

243
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:21,390
Who are you again?

244
00:26:21,524 --> 00:26:22,718
Oh, man...

245
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:28,780
OrgoCorp is in possession of some of the
most advanced cybergenetic IP in the galaxy.

246
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:33,968
So they're heavily guarded
by the deadly Orgosentries.

247
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:37,663
Now I know you don't have
documentation to dock.

248
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:40,124
So you're gonna have to
get in there on your own.

249
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:45,179
Once in, Gamora is gonna
lead you to the records.

250
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,436
Where maybe you can find the
pass key to override the kill switch.

251
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:52,124
And help you save the hedgehog.

252
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:54,280
But if you get into trouble,

253
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,179
we will not be able
to bail you out.

254
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,054
Yes.

255
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:18,124
Yes, of course.

256
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:23,811
Its functioning has skyrocketed.

257
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:30,350
That's correct, P13. Very good.

258
00:27:36,382 --> 00:27:38,155
That's the new world.

259
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:39,827
Counter-Earth.

260
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,866
Where the experiments will
go once they're ready.

261
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:45,522
- It blue.
- That's the sky.

262
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:46,827
Sky.

263
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:52,491
- Rocket.
- Yes, it is.

264
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,311
What sounds?

265
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:58,452
That's music.

266
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,311
- We like it?
- We do.

267
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:05,374
This recording is over 5,000 years old.

268
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,405
Which translated, is...

269
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:15,897
Be not as you are,
but as you should be.

270
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:18,069
It's our sacred mission

271
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:21,395
to take the cacophony
of sounds around us

272
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:24,515
and turn it into a song.

273
00:28:26,316 --> 00:28:31,600
To take an imperfect clump of
biological matter such as you,

274
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,304
and transform it into something...
perfect.

275
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:42,257
And we're halfway there, aren't we?

276
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:47,462
Come with me, P13.

277
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:49,600
I'd like to show you something.

278
00:28:54,018 --> 00:28:56,018
We have but a single quest...

279
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:58,444
To create the perfect species,

280
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,971
and the perfect society.

281
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:03,600
You, P13,

282
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:05,835
are part of batch 89.

283
00:29:06,306 --> 00:29:08,530
But here, with batch 90,

284
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:12,108
I've developed a process
by which I can guide

285
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:19,679
any organism through millions of years of
programmed evolution changes, in a moment.

286
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:51,788
See now...

287
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,319
There's the rub.

288
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:58,460
For some reason, these specimens

289
00:29:58,485 --> 00:30:03,952
are also over producing the legobeta
microsamino protein in their systems.

290
00:30:03,977 --> 00:30:05,670
Causing them to be, well...

291
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:08,077
Violent. We don't like it.

292
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:11,702
A utopia cannot have its denizens
murdering one another, can it?

293
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:13,482
They can't.

294
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:16,499
- Can't.
- Can't.

295
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:17,717
Theel.

296
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:25,139
They're programmed to be peaceful, like you.

297
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:28,295
But for some reason, it's not catching.

298
00:30:29,124 --> 00:30:30,874
Tectonic filters.

299
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:32,356
What?

300
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:36,514
They suppresaliding the glycusoride sources.

301
00:30:36,812 --> 00:30:38,585
And then, boop, boop, boop...

302
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,780
Absisting residual deformity.

303
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,420
And then, they, make, um...

304
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:47,538
- What do you say?
- The legobeta Microsamino proteins.

305
00:30:47,563 --> 00:30:49,155
Yeah, thems.

306
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,858
And then, angry turtleses.

307
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:43,238
There, that's the decompression chamber.

308
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:44,948
Lock in.

309
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,142
Go.

310
00:32:25,783 --> 00:32:28,228
Activate gravity boots and gloves.

311
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:38,231
Nebula, go.

312
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:15,294
So you really don't remember anything?

313
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:16,707
Like what?

314
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,161
- Bunch of time with us.
- No.

315
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:24,059
- Well, we were...
- We weren't anything.

316
00:33:24,647 --> 00:33:28,778
- You and me...
- That was some alternate future version of me.

317
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:31,278
Wasn't me.

318
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:34,012
We loved each other.

319
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,567
I don't think so.

320
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:41,621
I know you don't remember any of it...

321
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,676
You were everything to me.

322
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:49,957
I miss you.

323
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:52,793
So much.

324
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,231
And maybe...

325
00:33:56,146 --> 00:33:58,356
Maybe if you open yourself up to it...

326
00:34:00,727 --> 00:34:03,114
- There's a possibility...
- I don't think so, Quinn.

327
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:06,512
- Quill.
- Quill.

328
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:09,676
I don't think so.

329
00:34:10,003 --> 00:34:11,160
But what I'm trying to say...

330
00:34:11,185 --> 00:34:13,691
Peter, you know this
is an open line, right?

331
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:16,214
- What?
- We're listening to everything you're saying.

332
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:18,441
And it is painful.

333
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:19,597
And you're just telling me now?

334
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:21,300
We were hoping it
would stall on its own.

335
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,488
But I switched it over to private.

336
00:34:22,513 --> 00:34:23,925
What color button did you push?

337
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,292
Blue. For the blue suit.

338
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:27,972
- Oh, no.
- Blue is the open line for everyone.

339
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:29,222
Orange is for blue.

340
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,160
- What?
- Black is for orange.

341
00:34:31,187 --> 00:34:33,660
Yellow is for green.
Green is for red.

342
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:34,941
And red is for yellow.

343
00:34:34,966 --> 00:34:36,542
No, yellow is for yellow.

344
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:38,246
Green is for red.
Red is for green.

345
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:40,105
- I don't think so.
- Try it, then.

346
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:43,607
Hello!

347
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:47,691
- You were right.
- How the hell am I supposed to know all of that!?

348
00:34:47,716 --> 00:34:49,050
Seems intuitive.

349
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:51,581
Can we get back to saving our friend?

350
00:34:52,576 --> 00:34:54,576
Get that jammer ready
to change the shield.

351
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,467
Guys?

352
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:34,646
You wanna talk about a sweet ride?
The acceleration would crush your spine.

353
00:35:34,671 --> 00:35:37,756
It's got that brand new Fusilux core.
You know what I'm talking about?

354
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:40,201
- Oh, yeah.
- Really? Because I just made that up.

355
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:42,295
Oh, I thought you
said something else.

356
00:35:43,136 --> 00:35:44,428
Master Karja.

357
00:35:46,174 --> 00:35:48,174
- No, you didn't.
- I did... I did.

358
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:52,053
Master Karja, there appears to be a physical
breach in the white wing somewhere.

359
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:52,982
Could it be a glitch?

360
00:35:53,007 --> 00:35:54,092
Maybe?

361
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:01,662
I'm accessing the eye.

362
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:03,185
I'll see if I can locate it.

363
00:36:35,332 --> 00:36:39,001
There's some sort of anomaly in the decompression
chamber. Best to check it out, Master.

364
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:40,345
On it.

365
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,212
Hurry.

366
00:36:54,288 --> 00:36:55,361
Where do we put these?

367
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,838
Here! Hide them in this
locker until we leave.

368
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,072
Hurry.

369
00:37:24,621 --> 00:37:26,621
What the hell was that, guys?

370
00:37:28,903 --> 00:37:30,473
Are you kidding me?

371
00:37:30,802 --> 00:37:34,565
- What?
- A neutral cork just hit the satellite.

372
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:40,739
It's burning a hole thru the wall. You geniuses just
throw the door open without any precautionary procedure?

373
00:37:40,764 --> 00:37:42,247
What procedure, bro?

374
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,114
Oh, you want us to read the
manual for you too, bro?

375
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,139
You could have killed everyone in the wing.

376
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:50,244
Exactly, you idiots!

377
00:37:50,788 --> 00:37:52,137
I'm angry, too.

378
00:37:52,162 --> 00:37:53,192
Oh, no.

379
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:57,747
Can't you see these authentic mechanic
uniforms we're wearing on our bodies?

380
00:37:57,854 --> 00:38:00,277
That blend in with some of our
skin tones better than others?

381
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:04,301
Excuse my friend. He's the
boss' nephew. He's a little...

382
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:09,308
Oh...
Oh.

383
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:12,769
Yeah, I...
I got one of those too.

384
00:38:13,857 --> 00:38:16,722
This one? This one, I love.
I'm so proud of...

385
00:38:16,864 --> 00:38:18,457
You're doing great.
So proud of you.

386
00:38:18,512 --> 00:38:20,512
But this one...
I just...

387
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:29,619
Everything he does drives me crazy.

388
00:38:29,904 --> 00:38:31,904
- I thought you said something else.
- Shut up.

389
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:34,104
I swear I'm gonna throttle him.

390
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:35,963
I'm gonna go to jail for murder.
I am.

391
00:38:36,468 --> 00:38:37,807
How did you guys get here so fast?

392
00:38:38,095 --> 00:38:42,010
Gonna be honest with you, we just happened
in before it burned all the way through, thankfully.

393
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,963
Good thing you were here.

394
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,150
Alright guys, wrap it up.

395
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:48,175
Looks like we're all clear here.

396
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:54,237
Our spacesuits!

397
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,785
You threw them in the contamination bin.

398
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:02,426
It expels stuff into space the
moment you shut the door.

399
00:39:02,451 --> 00:39:05,465
That would have been helpful
information three minutes ago!

400
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,738
Dammit, Mantis, why don't you ever think?

401
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,441
Oh, are we pretending
to be angry again?

402
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:11,098
Mantis, you asshole!

403
00:39:11,123 --> 00:39:13,512
Guys, just focus for two seconds.

404
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:15,957
We'll find another way
out of here. Right now...

405
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,754
We need to save Rocket's life.

406
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:22,504
Nebula, Quinn and I will get to
the records and get the pass key.

407
00:39:22,808 --> 00:39:27,371
Bug and doufus, access the spaceport thru the
elevator so Tree can land and get us out of here.

408
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,340
- Oh, apologies.
- No problem.

409
00:39:31,657 --> 00:39:32,894
Go.

410
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:50,113
It's not my fault I don't know what
something is. No one ever tells me.

411
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:51,762
I didn't even want to come here.

412
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:53,019
I'm gonna need to see your...

413
00:39:53,044 --> 00:39:56,762
You're hopelessly in love... with him.

414
00:39:57,003 --> 00:39:58,387
Oh, no...

415
00:39:59,193 --> 00:40:01,316
- Hey.
- Hey.

416
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:04,275
How are you doing today?

417
00:40:04,842 --> 00:40:06,129
I'm alright.

418
00:40:08,803 --> 00:40:10,988
What was your name again?

419
00:40:11,332 --> 00:40:12,723
Drax the Destroyer.

420
00:40:14,191 --> 00:40:16,191
That's such a lovely name.

421
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,340
I'll get the door for you.

422
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:22,988
- I'll be here when you come back out, okay?
- Sure.

423
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,059
Every single time.

424
00:40:27,822 --> 00:40:29,691
My name is Brittle Snorte!

425
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,098
Welcome to OrgoCorp headquarters.

426
00:40:33,545 --> 00:40:40,527
For over 300 years OrgoCorp has been producing cybernetic
implants and genetic upgrades across the universe.

427
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:43,926
Under the watchful eye
of the High Evolutionary.

428
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:48,465
That warning we got today. Don't
those two match the description?

429
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:51,194
Attention all Orgosentries.

430
00:40:53,088 --> 00:40:55,215
That manager should
have access to the records.

431
00:40:56,445 --> 00:40:58,824
If the pass key is here,
she can get it for us.

432
00:40:59,517 --> 00:41:00,566
All right.

433
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,916
- I'll handle this one.
- How?

434
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,199
Pure Star-Lord charm.

435
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:08,363
I'm excited that you get to see
this again for the first time.

436
00:41:15,669 --> 00:41:17,669
Hi, Yura.

437
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:19,832
- Ura.
- Oh, Ura.

438
00:41:19,857 --> 00:41:22,754
- Hi.
- Hi, my name is Patrick Swayze.

439
00:41:23,344 --> 00:41:25,887
I've been noticing you
for quite a while.

440
00:41:25,912 --> 00:41:29,793
And whenever you smile to yourself,
when you think nobody is looking,

441
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:32,248
it makes my everyday a bit brighter.

442
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,787
We need your hand, and it's your choice
whether it's on your body, or not!

443
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:37,138
What are you doing?

444
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:38,654
She was never gonna fall for that.

445
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,107
She was totally into me, man.

446
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:41,787
I kinda thought you
were a douchebag.

447
00:41:41,812 --> 00:41:42,724
Oh, come on.

448
00:41:42,749 --> 00:41:43,927
- We need a file.
- What file?

449
00:41:43,952 --> 00:41:46,373
89P13. Would that be something?

450
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:49,365
- No.
- Then your use to us is over.

451
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,349
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

452
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,084
Sounds like a species tag.

453
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,349
Show us!

454
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:01,826
All of our research supports the High
Evolutionary's altruistic objective,

455
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:04,709
of creating a utopian society.

456
00:42:04,714 --> 00:42:06,714
That must be the spaceport.

457
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:13,701
Whoa.

458
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:15,224
What is all this?

459
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:18,990
Species patented over the
years using OrgoCorp tech.

460
00:42:19,129 --> 00:42:23,295
Every species Orgocorp has created
has its own individual file.

461
00:42:23,684 --> 00:42:27,052
I am so sorry about this. Listen to me,
this is not the kinda thing we do.

462
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,545
Oh, please, stop it
with the subtle jabs!

463
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,982
Old you would've never done this.

464
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,232
You had a purpose higher than
yourself, the calling to help people.

465
00:42:33,257 --> 00:42:35,257
That's why you left Thanos
and formed the Guardians.

466
00:42:35,282 --> 00:42:38,974
Except I didn't form the Guardians
and I barely left Thanos.

467
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:42,201
Whoever it was that
you were in love with,

468
00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:44,615
it wasn't me.

469
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:46,404
It sounds more like her.

470
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:47,365
- Her?
- What?

471
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,873
- That's ridiculous...
- Do not drag me into this.

472
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:56,807
- Knock it off!
- What?

473
00:42:56,832 --> 00:42:59,557
Don't look at me like a lost puppy
needing a safe place to lie down!

474
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:01,268
I didn't say anything.

475
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,560
I just never noticed how
black your eyes were.

476
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,606
They were replaced by my father

477
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,731
as a method of torture.

478
00:43:14,756 --> 00:43:17,229
He picked a pretty set.

479
00:43:19,522 --> 00:43:20,574
There.

480
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:24,137
That's the file for 89P13.

481
00:43:51,247 --> 00:43:52,546
Oh, no.

482
00:43:54,017 --> 00:43:55,116
Walk!

483
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:58,764
Run, run.

484
00:44:04,698 --> 00:44:06,077
Stand down!

485
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:08,874
Drax, we should make a run for it.

486
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:10,350
- Or we can fight.
- Run.

487
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:11,733
- Fight.
- Run!

488
00:44:11,742 --> 00:44:14,381
- Fight!
- Take 'em!

489
00:44:18,718 --> 00:44:20,054
What are we going to do?

490
00:44:21,756 --> 00:44:23,061
- I got a plan.
- What is it?

491
00:44:23,086 --> 00:44:24,194
All of you, come with---

492
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:29,139
Everybody, lower your weapons or
I blow this woman's brain out!

493
00:44:29,164 --> 00:44:30,475
That's the plan?

494
00:44:31,234 --> 00:44:32,327
You're a kitty cat.

495
00:44:36,019 --> 00:44:38,019
You feel like dancing.

496
00:44:39,674 --> 00:44:40,913
Violent rage.

497
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:48,582
Lower your weapons!

498
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:55,113
Now kill that one that looks like a
carrot to show we mean business.

499
00:44:55,983 --> 00:44:58,121
God! Past Gamora's just mean!

500
00:44:58,146 --> 00:45:01,074
She was always like that,
and yet I was the bad guy.

501
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,099
We are not killing anyone!

502
00:45:03,156 --> 00:45:04,410
Back off!

503
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:09,324
Groot, bring the Bowie to us. Now!

504
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:23,254
- I'm so sorry about this, Ura.
- Oh, please.

505
00:45:23,324 --> 00:45:26,793
We're here to save the
life of our friend. That is all.

506
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,621
We paid her to help
us get in and get out.

507
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:33,441
You'd think that'd mean, "oh, I'm gonna help them do
it in a way that no one knows what's happening."

508
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:36,840
But no. What she means is I'm gonna
shoot people. Threaten people's lives.

509
00:45:36,865 --> 00:45:38,387
Shut up!

510
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:42,059
And now I know you're probably
asking "why would I trust her?" Well...

511
00:45:42,187 --> 00:45:43,582
That's a good question.

512
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:45,371
The answer is...

513
00:45:45,737 --> 00:45:47,199
We used to be in love.

514
00:45:47,253 --> 00:45:51,160
Yeah, she was my girlfriend. Only she
doesn't remember it because it wasn't her.

515
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:55,652
Because her dad threw her off a magic cliff and she died.
Then I lost my temper and nearly destroyed half the universe.

516
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:59,190
And she came back.
Out of the past. There she is.

517
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:03,566
Anyone else who died in the past stayed dead.
Not her. Why? Was it the magic cliff? I don't know.

518
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:06,207
I'm not some freakin'
Infinity Stone scientist.

519
00:46:07,637 --> 00:46:11,007
Just some dumbass Earth dude
who met a girl, fell in love.

520
00:46:11,378 --> 00:46:13,145
That girl died,

521
00:46:13,223 --> 00:46:15,488
and then came
back a total dick.

522
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,684
You left out some important
information, but...

523
00:46:21,285 --> 00:46:22,949
That is the gist of it.

524
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:30,801
Get to the security helm.

525
00:46:30,826 --> 00:46:32,066
Okay!

526
00:46:40,996 --> 00:46:43,780
Everybody down on the floor
or we blow your brains out.

527
00:46:43,805 --> 00:46:45,936
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
We don't want any---

528
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:50,960
Come on! Will you please
stop doing that?

529
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:18,366
Hey!

530
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:35,379
Run.

531
00:48:06,325 --> 00:48:08,170
Drax!

532
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:13,655
Get on the ground, and
show me your hands now.

533
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,670
Ura...

534
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,991
Please listen to me. We need
to get out of here with this.

535
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:29,772
To save my best friend's life.

536
00:48:30,218 --> 00:48:34,170
If you can get us into the systems of those
sentries out there, they are good people, like you...

537
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:35,569
I'm certain of it.

538
00:48:35,594 --> 00:48:37,639
And if I just had an
opportunity to speak to them...

539
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,255
They're corporate shills, you idiot.
They're not gonna listen.

540
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,812
They will listen if I speak
to them from my heart.

541
00:48:44,092 --> 00:48:45,264
Ura...

542
00:48:45,943 --> 00:48:47,069
please.

543
00:48:56,551 --> 00:48:57,663
Hey!

544
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,514
Come out now!

545
00:49:03,122 --> 00:49:04,532
Damn it!

546
00:49:06,904 --> 00:49:07,928
Stop!

547
00:49:11,384 --> 00:49:13,764
You are in.

548
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:16,659
- Tell them your truce---
- Yeah, I'm not that big of an idiot.

549
00:49:16,759 --> 00:49:18,499
I just needed to get
into the system.

550
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:33,670
Told you she was into me.

551
00:49:55,068 --> 00:49:56,368
I am Groot.

552
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,321
Yeah. That looked cool.

553
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:10,734
Is sky?

554
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:12,992
No.

555
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:16,203
That's not sky. That's a ceiling.

556
00:50:16,987 --> 00:50:20,421
Sire is making a
new world for all of us.

557
00:50:20,522 --> 00:50:22,359
And when we get there,

558
00:50:22,598 --> 00:50:24,296
there will be sky,

559
00:50:24,565 --> 00:50:26,565
and it will be beautiful.

560
00:50:26,616 --> 00:50:28,328
And forever.

561
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,947
I have been thinking.

562
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:36,906
About what?

563
00:50:36,944 --> 00:50:39,265
Oh, nothing in particular.

564
00:50:39,822 --> 00:50:43,258
But I thought, since you
guys are my closest friends,

565
00:50:43,348 --> 00:50:45,148
and my only friends,

566
00:50:45,432 --> 00:50:49,867
you might be interested in knowing
that I have been thinking.

567
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,503
That's cool.

568
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:53,937
I've been thinking, too.

569
00:50:54,003 --> 00:50:56,640
About something more singular.

570
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,805
When sire moves
us to the new world,

571
00:51:00,301 --> 00:51:01,937
we're gonna need names.

572
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:07,890
I mean, 89Q12...
Not really a name.

573
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:09,859
So...

574
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,992
I would like my name to be...

575
00:51:14,189 --> 00:51:15,242
Lylla.

576
00:51:15,982 --> 00:51:17,289
Lylla.

577
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:18,882
Lylla.

578
00:51:19,088 --> 00:51:20,546
Lylla.

579
00:51:20,757 --> 00:51:22,757
That's a pretty name, Lylla.

580
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,367
Thank you.

581
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,593
I think my name shall be Teefs.

582
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:32,932
Because although
we all do have them,

583
00:51:33,254 --> 00:51:35,648
mine are definitely
the most prominent.

584
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:39,273
- Teefs.
- Teefs.

585
00:51:39,298 --> 00:51:40,765
- Lylla.
- Teefs.

586
00:51:41,843 --> 00:51:43,703
Me be called Floor...

587
00:51:43,757 --> 00:51:46,593
Because me is lying on floor.

588
00:51:46,675 --> 00:51:49,921
You're lying on a floor,
so your name is Floor?

589
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:52,472
Yeah.

590
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:54,957
Floor.

591
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,269
What about you, friend?

592
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:04,300
Someday, I'm gonna make
great machines that fly.

593
00:52:04,936 --> 00:52:08,019
And me and my friends are
going to go flying together.

594
00:52:08,263 --> 00:52:11,582
Into the forever
and beautiful sky.

595
00:52:12,175 --> 00:52:16,035
Lylla, and Teefs, and Floor...

596
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:17,894
And me.

597
00:52:19,111 --> 00:52:20,160
Rocket.

598
00:52:22,954 --> 00:52:24,457
Rocket.

599
00:52:25,278 --> 00:52:27,777
It really is good to have friends.

600
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,582
Yeah.

601
00:52:35,245 --> 00:52:36,886
Start the incision here.

602
00:52:39,593 --> 00:52:40,816
Keep calm.

603
00:52:43,848 --> 00:52:47,714
- Hold it still.
- I can't. It won't stop moving!

604
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:52,035
Why did he never tell
us about any of this?

605
00:52:52,178 --> 00:52:54,722
This is worse than what
Thanos did to me.

606
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:57,738
But what about the pass key?

607
00:52:58,078 --> 00:52:59,191
Is it there?

608
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,402
No. But a file was
removed today.

609
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:07,925
Downloaded and deleted a
million characters at length.

610
00:53:08,022 --> 00:53:10,222
The biometrics say
it was this man.

611
00:53:10,247 --> 00:53:12,247
Recorder B2H6.

612
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:14,355
I saw this guy outside
of records today.

613
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,886
Looks like one of the
High Evolutionary's recorders.

614
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:21,277
The High Evolutionary?

615
00:53:21,822 --> 00:53:23,207
The founder of OrgoCorp?

616
00:53:23,232 --> 00:53:27,261
OrgoCorp is just a way to fund his
experiments that lie outside intergalactic laws.

617
00:53:27,401 --> 00:53:29,574
He's created whole societies.

618
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:32,011
Xeronians, the Animen.

619
00:53:32,036 --> 00:53:33,238
- Sovereign.
- The Sovereign?

620
00:53:33,263 --> 00:53:35,707
Corners of the universe
consider him god.

621
00:53:37,376 --> 00:53:39,376
- I am Groot.
- Yes.

622
00:53:39,662 --> 00:53:41,019
Yes, what? That he's Groot?

623
00:53:41,044 --> 00:53:44,472
He said maybe this man downloaded the
pass key into the computer on his head.

624
00:53:44,735 --> 00:53:45,659
Huh?

625
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:48,050
That can store the pass key.

626
00:53:48,075 --> 00:53:49,840
If we find him, we save Rocket.

627
00:53:50,618 --> 00:53:53,004
The High Evolutionary's coordinates.

628
00:53:54,244 --> 00:53:55,754
Put the coordinates in the nav.

629
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:57,410
Wait a minute.

630
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:58,863
Are you kidding me?

631
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:02,254
What he wants is that
gutted badger in the med bay.

632
00:54:02,279 --> 00:54:04,279
And you're gonna bring
it straight to him?

633
00:54:04,811 --> 00:54:06,441
It's almost certainly a trap.

634
00:54:06,466 --> 00:54:09,355
A trap isn't a trap if you know the trap
is trying to trap you. It's a face-off.

635
00:54:09,395 --> 00:54:11,246
A face-off is a trap

636
00:54:11,271 --> 00:54:15,340
if you're facing off against a guy a thousand
times more powerful than you.

637
00:54:15,971 --> 00:54:18,121
Do you know who
the High Evolutionary is?

638
00:54:18,146 --> 00:54:21,340
Yeah, he's some dickhead who
dissected my best friend.

639
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:22,300
Second best.

640
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:25,465
The High Evolutionary isn't someone
you wanna think about messing with.

641
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,402
We won't think about
it when we do it.

642
00:54:27,669 --> 00:54:29,519
You know what? I don't care.

643
00:54:29,544 --> 00:54:32,965
Just drop me off with the Ravagers and
you go do whatever it is you wanna do.

644
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,199
We don't have time for this.

645
00:54:34,224 --> 00:54:36,738
I'm not asking you. Drop me
off with my people now.

646
00:54:36,763 --> 00:54:38,261
Your people?

647
00:54:38,392 --> 00:54:41,847
The Ravagers aren't your people.
I'm a damn Ravager. You aren't.

648
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:46,012
Listen, I know you were always
looking for a family, okay?

649
00:54:46,037 --> 00:54:48,871
But my Gamora, the one I loved, she
didn't find it with a group of criminals.

650
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:50,316
She found it with us.

651
00:54:50,459 --> 00:54:52,597
People who care about you.

652
00:54:52,811 --> 00:54:54,811
I know that's who you still are.

653
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:57,043
Somewhere inside of you...

654
00:55:00,569 --> 00:55:05,535
What are you so afraid of in yourself,
that I need to be something for you?

655
00:55:05,715 --> 00:55:08,480
I don't give a shit
about your Gamora!

656
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,793
Life made me me!

657
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,418
I have a few upgrades courtesy of
that gutted badger in the med bay.

658
00:55:15,443 --> 00:55:18,566
And we are not risking his life
to make yours more convenient.

659
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:21,746
- I'm family.
- So is he.

660
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,097
Screw you.

661
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,420
Screw all of you.

662
00:56:14,266 --> 00:56:16,266
Found him on the outskirts
of the first shield,

663
00:56:16,448 --> 00:56:18,448
pirating supply ships.

664
00:56:19,51 --> 00:56:21,206
I do appreciate this, good sir.

665
00:56:21,232 --> 00:56:24,979
And I appreciate your contribution
to the Orgosentry retirement fund.

666
00:56:25,116 --> 00:56:26,378
Your associate.

667
00:56:27,014 --> 00:56:29,823
A Zehoberi named Gamora.

668
00:56:30,195 --> 00:56:32,284
- Where is she now.
- You'll get nothing from me!

669
00:56:32,31 --> 00:56:34,996
Oh, we'll see about
that, won't we?

670
00:56:35,613 --> 00:56:37,004
Adam.

671
00:56:38,24 --> 00:56:39,355
Adam!

672
00:56:39,476 --> 00:56:42,184
- Yes, mother.
- Show him we mean business.

673
00:57:03,692 --> 00:57:06,021
I said show him we mean business!

674
00:57:06,045 --> 00:57:07,091
Not disintegrate him!

675
00:57:07,116 --> 00:57:08,543
Well, what business could
we have shown him?

676
00:57:08,569 --> 00:57:10,239
But now he is
of no use to us!

677
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:11,591
Well let's just question the man's friend!

678
00:57:11,616 --> 00:57:14,418
Friend? You think that's
a friend? It's an animal!

679
00:57:16,909 --> 00:57:18,192
He looks sad.

680
00:57:20,026 --> 00:57:22,223
I really don't enjoy how that's
making me feel, actually.

681
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:28,254
Your friend's a moron. I got
one of those, too. I get it.

682
00:57:28,872 --> 00:57:30,152
Outpost?

683
00:57:30,221 --> 00:57:31,935
This is Gamora. Are you there?

684
00:57:34,406 --> 00:57:36,06
If you can pick this up, come in.

685
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:42,982
Outpost, come in.

686
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:45,646
Yes, Gamora.

687
00:57:46,246 --> 00:57:47,536
Salutations.

688
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:49,122
May I help?

689
00:57:49,937 --> 00:57:51,937
Well, I need you guys
to come pick me up.

690
00:57:51,962 --> 00:57:54,888
I'm gonna upload the location
link to the craft I'm on.

691
00:57:55,037 --> 00:57:56,872
Oh, I think we can arrange that.

692
00:58:53,629 --> 00:58:56,943
You need to say to him exactly
what I told you to say.

693
00:58:57,69 --> 00:58:58,786
Why don't you just say it?

694
00:58:58,811 --> 00:59:00,811
No one ever listens to me.

695
00:59:16,215 --> 00:59:17,325
Quill.

696
00:59:18,283 --> 00:59:20,013
Life is a pond.

697
00:59:20,513 --> 00:59:26,393
And you spent your entire life leaping from woman
to woman, as if they are lily pads upon this great pond.

698
00:59:26,807 --> 00:59:29,263
Perhaps what you need to do, Quill...

699
00:59:30,617 --> 00:59:32,255
... is learn to swim.

700
00:59:35,861 --> 00:59:38,13
- That actually made sense.
- Yes it made sense.

701
00:59:38,258 --> 00:59:40,584
No, I mean, 'cause that's
sort of an analogy.

702
00:59:41,147 --> 00:59:44,403
I didn't know that you were
capable of that... I thought...

703
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:46,489
I know lots of analogies, Quill.

704
00:59:46,676 --> 00:59:48,974
Analogies, metaphors, etcetera?

705
00:59:50,037 --> 00:59:51,107
For instance...

706
00:59:52,192 --> 00:59:54,466
Gamora's head is like a lily pad.

707
00:59:54,703 --> 00:59:55,964
Because it's green.

708
00:59:57,195 --> 00:59:58,435
Analogy.

709
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:01,317
And also, stupid-looking and flappy.

710
01:00:01,4 --> 01:00:04,692
- Flappy?
- Because her skin is made of leaf.

711
01:00:05,158 --> 01:00:07,247
- Metaphor.
- Is it?

712
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:10,902
Yesterday, I made a poop
shaped like a fish.

713
01:00:11,009 --> 01:00:14,918
Even my butt, is capable
of making an analogy.

714
01:00:18,685 --> 01:00:19,716
Oh.

715
01:00:25,192 --> 01:00:26,466
What's happening?

716
01:00:26,509 --> 01:00:28,161
The fluid is in his lungs.

717
01:00:29,345 --> 01:00:31,021
P13!

718
01:00:32,244 --> 01:00:33,63
P13!

719
01:00:35,439 --> 01:00:36,505
Sire.

720
01:00:37,615 --> 01:00:39,036
P13!

721
01:00:44,857 --> 01:00:49,021
Sire was in the middle of his treatment,
soon we had a breakthrough with that tube.

722
01:00:49,053 --> 01:00:50,879
Perhaps then we should resume tomorrow...

723
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:52,881
We will not resume tomorrow, no!

724
01:00:53,114 --> 01:00:54,522
P13

725
01:00:57,638 --> 01:00:58,747
Oh, ooh, there you are.

726
01:01:08,691 --> 01:01:09,817
Hello.

727
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:26,311
How did you know about
the microsamino proteins, P13?

728
01:01:49,94 --> 01:01:51,94
What happened in there?

729
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:53,676
Why?

730
01:01:54,266 --> 01:01:57,06
How did you know, P13?

731
01:01:57,085 --> 01:01:58,731
It was too little filtration.

732
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:01,727
In the hyperthermic, yes, we know.
We fixed that.

733
01:02:01,771 --> 01:02:03,45
But how did you know?

734
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:06,433
I made you!

735
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:08,533
How did you know!?

736
01:02:12,835 --> 01:02:14,183
Because it worked.

737
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:22,34
It worked...

738
01:02:25,069 --> 01:02:27,59
The rage, is gone.

739
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:31,2
We have the peaceful creatures
we always sought...

740
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:33,786
Ready to inhabit the new world.

741
01:02:36,477 --> 01:02:38,477
We're going to the new world?

742
01:02:39,257 --> 01:02:41,903
Oh... we?

743
01:02:44,404 --> 01:02:45,856
Look at you.

744
01:02:45,998 --> 01:02:50,317
It's if you were cobbled
together by fat-fingered children.

745
01:02:50,342 --> 01:02:53,262
How could you be part
of a perfect species?

746
01:02:53,325 --> 01:02:55,01
You're simply a...

747
01:02:55,189 --> 01:03:00,489
medley of mistakes we could learn from in
the plight of the creatures that truly matter.

748
01:03:01,364 --> 01:03:03,067
Batch 89...

749
01:03:03,487 --> 01:03:06,503
was never meant for
the new world, P13.

750
01:03:06,656 --> 01:03:12,02
You could figure out the complex workings
of cytoplasmic filtration systems,

751
01:03:12,073 --> 01:03:14,073
but you couldn't figure out that?

752
01:03:18,14 --> 01:03:19,637
But that brain...

753
01:03:20,92 --> 01:03:22,92
That, I'd like to study further.

754
01:03:27,543 --> 01:03:30,997
Prep it for surgery and
removal in the morning.

755
01:03:31,857 --> 01:03:34,184
What about the rest
of batch 89, sire?

756
01:03:37,553 --> 01:03:39,028
Incinerate them.

757
01:03:46,873 --> 01:03:49,777
He's dying. We need that pass key.

758
01:03:50,432 --> 01:03:51,747
We don't have long.

759
01:03:52,944 --> 01:03:54,387
We've arrived.

760
01:04:09,652 --> 01:04:13,069
That looks just like... home.

761
01:04:25,965 --> 01:04:27,811
It's like a replica of Earth.

762
01:04:28,019 --> 01:04:29,218
It makes no sense.

763
01:04:29,293 --> 01:04:32,468
Atmosphere is habitable.
Gravity is and/or minus one.

764
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:28,577
Hello. We mean
you no harm.

765
01:05:39,621 --> 01:05:41,865
Listen to me, he was just trying
to throw her back the ball.

766
01:05:47,635 --> 01:05:48,834
Please, no...

767
01:05:50,459 --> 01:05:51,537
Hey! Hey.

768
01:05:51,562 --> 01:05:53,662
Groot! Full kaiju!

769
01:05:54,122 --> 01:05:58,818
- Not full kaiju!
- I am Groooooot!

770
01:06:04,763 --> 01:06:06,2
Get down, Groot!

771
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:08,372
Everybody, it's okay.
Hey.

772
01:06:08,706 --> 01:06:10,706
Hi. We're not here to harm you.

773
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:14,192
Okay... you see?

774
01:06:15,896 --> 01:06:17,179
For your knee.

775
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:21,349
We just need to
save our friend.

776
01:06:26,92 --> 01:06:28,514
It doesn't belong here.

777
01:06:30,043 --> 01:06:32,043
I will train it in the
ways of the Sovereign.

778
01:06:35,267 --> 01:06:36,639
I will train him not to do that.

779
01:06:36,64 --> 01:06:38,982
The blasphemy
even having it here.

780
01:06:39,58 --> 01:06:41,256
Kill it! Now.

781
01:06:41,968 --> 01:06:45,888
I'm the Warlock, mum, and I'm
done of being ordered around.

782
01:06:47,223 --> 01:06:48,756
Gamora is here.

783
01:06:49,685 --> 01:06:52,303
Which means the squirrel is, also...

784
01:06:52,4 --> 01:06:56,513
To save ourselves, we must bring it to the
High Evolutionary before his own people do.

785
01:07:21,045 --> 01:07:23,278
Yeah, yeah. Sit. Let's sit.

786
01:07:23,546 --> 01:07:24,552
Okay.

787
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:35,127
I am Groot.

788
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:36,986
It's not rude, it's what it's here for.

789
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,369
Drax, sit up! Idiot.

790
01:07:41,955 --> 01:07:43,022
Thank you.

791
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:48,385
Thank you.

792
01:07:49,861 --> 01:07:51,666
Our friend,

793
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:54,143
he's dying.

794
01:08:00,353 --> 01:08:03,533
We love our friend.

795
01:08:04,978 --> 01:08:06,322
But he is dying.

796
01:08:09,12 --> 01:08:11,697
That's not dying.
That's already dead.

797
01:08:11,757 --> 01:08:13,188
They'll think he's already dead.

798
01:08:13,213 --> 01:08:15,337
They'll think we are
here on a quest for revenge.

799
01:08:15,363 --> 01:08:17,244
Drax, sit up!

800
01:08:17,269 --> 01:08:19,408
- That's what it's here for.
- Drax, it isn't.

801
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:23,619
It's made for people to sit shoulder to shoulder right
next to each other. Get your boots off their pillows.

802
01:08:23,644 --> 01:08:26,205
I find it hard to believe it doesn't
have a multiple purpose.

803
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:28,688
I'm sorry. My friend is a dumbass.

804
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:31,377
That's the same as your dying.

805
01:08:31,402 --> 01:08:33,252
Why do you criticize everything?

806
01:08:33,277 --> 01:08:34,369
So why is the couch long then?

807
01:08:34,394 --> 01:08:36,291
It was a totally different sound.

808
01:08:36,316 --> 01:08:39,127
No it isn't. Ugh! Dying... ugh!
Dumbass... see? It's the same.

809
01:08:39,152 --> 01:08:41,963
Alright, guys. Can I proceed, please?

810
01:08:41,988 --> 01:08:43,111
We're trying to save our friend.

811
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,416
Drax, I see you.

812
01:08:45,775 --> 01:08:50,251
I understand that none of this
makes any sense to you right now.

813
01:08:50,786 --> 01:08:52,786
We need your help

814
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:55,994
in finding a man.

815
01:08:56,751 --> 01:09:00,322
I'm gonna draw. I'm gonna draw
the man that we're looking for.

816
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,391
You see the thing on her head?
He has a thing...

817
01:09:07,417 --> 01:09:08,518
That is delightful.

818
01:09:10,176 --> 01:09:11,369
There you go.

819
01:09:11,924 --> 01:09:14,221
Have you seen this man?

820
01:09:16,07 --> 01:09:17,783
That's very good.

821
01:09:17,807 --> 01:09:19,697
Can I have that later to hang
on my apartment, please?

822
01:09:19,831 --> 01:09:21,643
Yeah, thank you.

823
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:24,985
His name? His name is Motio?

824
01:09:43,828 --> 01:09:46,314
Many Motios. There?

825
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:48,611
That pyramid?

826
01:09:50,856 --> 01:09:53,705
Is that your car
in the driveway?

827
01:09:59,26 --> 01:10:01,596
Drax, stay here with Rocket.

828
01:10:01,873 --> 01:10:03,29
Watch him, that's who
they're coming for.

829
01:10:03,316 --> 01:10:04,712
- I want to come!
- No.

830
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:06,447
Mantis, watch Drax.

831
01:10:06,472 --> 01:10:09,18
Groot, you know what
to do with these.

832
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:17,822
Push down on it.

833
01:10:17,854 --> 01:10:19,087
- What?
- Push it down.

834
01:10:19,113 --> 01:10:20,438
I am pushing down on it.

835
01:10:20,464 --> 01:10:21,837
Push the button.

836
01:10:22,689 --> 01:10:24,141
Looks like you're pushing the keyhole.

837
01:10:24,167 --> 01:10:26,424
- What?
- There's a button under the handle.

838
01:10:26,633 --> 01:10:27,955
Press that in.

839
01:10:29,287 --> 01:10:31,056
Okay. Now what?

840
01:10:31,081 --> 01:10:32,533
Open the fucking door!

841
01:10:34,789 --> 01:10:36,789
That is a stupid design.

842
01:10:36,814 --> 01:10:39,4
And the instructions
were very unclear!

843
01:10:40,243 --> 01:10:42,243
Let's get that pass key
and save our friend.

844
01:10:49,088 --> 01:10:52,95
I was 8 years old when I left Earth, okay? Why would
I know any more about driving one of these than you do?

845
01:10:52,975 --> 01:10:54,185
Don't say you're volunteering.

846
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:55,692
- You want me to drive? I'll drive.
- No!

847
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:57,911
I don't want you
to drive. I got this.

848
01:11:42,657 --> 01:11:44,942
You must be
a really loyal pet

849
01:11:45,66 --> 01:11:48,419
if they're willing to
do all this for you.

850
01:12:57,495 --> 01:12:59,211
This is the perfect society?

851
01:13:20,747 --> 01:13:21,509
Sire...

852
01:13:21,534 --> 01:13:25,518
This one has been running for two
hours without breaking a sweat.

853
01:13:25,551 --> 01:13:26,314
That's incredible, if I...

854
01:13:26,34 --> 01:13:31,158
They can survive on 30 calories a day and
half of sleep a week. They are always happy.

855
01:13:31,26 --> 01:13:35,471
And they can rewire a carbonetrix
core in under two minutes.

856
01:13:35,971 --> 01:13:38,65
But will she be ready
for the new colony?

857
01:13:39,404 --> 01:13:41,404
Sire, they're here.

858
01:13:47,86 --> 01:13:49,041
Here we go.

859
01:13:57,03 --> 01:14:00,518
- We're here to see...
- The High Evolutionary's expecting you.

860
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:02,189
Which means it is a trap.

861
01:14:02,215 --> 01:14:03,448
It's a face-off.

862
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,994
She stays here.

863
01:14:05,019 --> 01:14:07,04
- Why?
- Policy against weaponry.

864
01:14:07,066 --> 01:14:09,066
And your arm is a gun.

865
01:14:13,411 --> 01:14:15,276
- He's clean.
- Let's go.

866
01:14:15,777 --> 01:14:16,783
Hey.

867
01:14:18,043 --> 01:14:19,134
It'll be okay.

868
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:41,388
Move it!

869
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:02,801
Are you okay, Rocket?

870
01:15:20,498 --> 01:15:22,149
Me and Rocket play now?

871
01:15:22,174 --> 01:15:23,595
I can't right now, Floor.

872
01:15:30,912 --> 01:15:33,485
- What are you doing?
- They ain't gonna set us free.

873
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:37,97
Yes they are, Rocket. We're going
to the new world any day now.

874
01:15:41,262 --> 01:15:42,712
No, that can't be true.

875
01:15:42,763 --> 01:15:43,876
It is.

876
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,623
They wanna kill
us all in the morning.

877
01:15:46,647 --> 01:15:48,259
- What?
- What?

878
01:15:48,949 --> 01:15:50,949
But I'm gonna fix it.

879
01:15:56,172 --> 01:15:57,376
What is that?

880
01:15:57,444 --> 01:15:58,673
It's a key.

881
01:15:59,442 --> 01:16:01,442
I'm gonna use it to
get us all outta here.

882
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,557
I don't know if
that's wise, Rocket.

883
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:10,007
Me, Rocket, leave!
Hurray, friends forever!

884
01:16:10,411 --> 01:16:11,899
Just down that hall,

885
01:16:12,097 --> 01:16:13,376
there's ships.

886
01:16:14,087 --> 01:16:17,97
I know that if we can
get to one, I can pilot it.

887
01:16:18,509 --> 01:16:20,656
And then we'll all
fly away together.

888
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:24,399
The four of us, just like
we always said, okay?

889
01:16:26,817 --> 01:16:28,003
Okay?

890
01:16:32,891 --> 01:16:36,024
Woohoo! Yippee, Rocket!
Sky, sky, sky!

891
01:16:58,706 --> 01:16:59,982
You did it!

892
01:17:00,028 --> 01:17:03,545
You did it!

893
01:17:24,9 --> 01:17:26,001
You did it!

894
01:17:29,805 --> 01:17:31,181
It really is good to have---

895
01:17:48,367 --> 01:17:51,214
Yes, I imagined you'd
do something like this.

896
01:17:52,245 --> 01:17:53,988
Back in the cage, P13.

897
01:18:00,117 --> 01:18:01,518
Sky...

898
01:18:15,79 --> 01:18:19,339
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

899
01:18:19,387 --> 01:18:23,238
Q12 and P13 escaped
from their pens.

900
01:18:23,397 --> 01:18:25,745
Q12 is neutralized, but...

901
01:18:25,878 --> 01:18:27,354
P13 is still out,

902
01:18:27,379 --> 01:18:29,277
so I'll need assistance.

903
01:18:29,567 --> 01:18:31,183
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

904
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,589
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

905
01:18:32,613 --> 01:18:34,581
Remember, not
to bruise its brain.

906
01:18:42,072 --> 01:18:44,072
Alright, P13!

907
01:18:44,097 --> 01:18:47,003
You win the crying contest,
now back in the cage!

908
01:18:50,522 --> 01:18:52,286
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

909
01:18:52,611 --> 01:18:54,988
Just go! Rocket, please!

910
01:18:55,016 --> 01:18:57,214
Rocket! Rocket!

911
01:18:59,637 --> 01:19:01,637
Down here, hurry!

912
01:20:48,065 --> 01:20:49,3
What are you doing?

913
01:20:49,325 --> 01:20:50,831
I have a bad feeling about this.

914
01:20:50,856 --> 01:20:52,682
Peter just told you to stay here.

915
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:53,94
Yeah well, that's his fault.

916
01:20:53,965 --> 01:20:56,9
He should know by now that I never
do anything that anyone ever tells me.

917
01:20:57,263 --> 01:20:59,073
We need to protect Rocket.

918
01:20:59,399 --> 01:21:00,924
Yeah, that's right.

919
01:21:01,344 --> 01:21:04,01
So hop on. And we'll
ride back to the ship.

920
01:21:04,036 --> 01:21:05,689
Just right over there?

921
01:21:06,491 --> 01:21:07,533
Yeah.

922
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:21,286
Drax! Hey, stop being a jerk.

923
01:21:30,01 --> 01:21:33,137
You! Hey! Yeah, you.

924
01:21:34,49 --> 01:21:37,254
I take it the pass key, it's in
that thing on your head.

925
01:21:37,441 --> 01:21:39,441
I would advise
against aggression.

926
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:42,34
Oh, got time for me now?

927
01:21:42,746 --> 01:21:45,715
Your friend once took advantage.

928
01:21:46,181 --> 01:21:47,691
I learned my lessons.

929
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:53,613
I aimed some small part of my mental
capacity back in my own direction.

930
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:57,723
And now, gravity itself
serves my whims.

931
01:21:58,294 --> 01:22:00,566
War Pig, now.

932
01:22:04,075 --> 01:22:06,433
You must find Counter-Earth familiar.

933
01:22:06,459 --> 01:22:09,676
- Counter-Earth.
- I visited your planet many years ago.

934
01:22:09,7 --> 01:22:11,503
Earth hasn't been my
planet in a long time.

935
01:22:11,528 --> 01:22:12,706
Your people had...

936
01:22:13,539 --> 01:22:14,676
Wonderful spirit.

937
01:22:15,14 --> 01:22:17,473
The art, music and literature,

938
01:22:17,497 --> 01:22:19,456
were some of the
finest in the universe.

939
01:22:20,107 --> 01:22:25,198
Earth would be a fabulous place were
it not for the ignorance and bigotry.

940
01:22:25,223 --> 01:22:27,738
- Okay.
- It inspired me to create Counter-Earth.

941
01:22:27,763 --> 01:22:30,645
- I don't care...
- All of the good and none of the bad.

942
01:22:30,67 --> 01:22:33,652
I don't need another speech
by some impotent whackjob

943
01:22:33,677 --> 01:22:37,566
whose mother didn't love him, rationalizing
why he needs to conquer the universe.

944
01:22:37,76 --> 01:22:41,176
I'm not trying to
conquer the universe...

945
01:22:41,271 --> 01:22:42,605
I'm perfecting it.

946
01:22:48,417 --> 01:22:49,91
What the...

947
01:23:09,295 --> 01:23:10,331
Hey!

948
01:23:10,674 --> 01:23:12,488
Drop the badger.

949
01:23:16,902 --> 01:23:18,176
I just want the pass key.

950
01:23:18,2 --> 01:23:20,573
Then bring me 89P13.

951
01:23:20,598 --> 01:23:22,09
I am Groot.

952
01:23:22,351 --> 01:23:24,176
He says suck my---

953
01:23:24,2 --> 01:23:25,793
Why are you so angry?

954
01:23:25,817 --> 01:23:27,817
Because I know what
you did to our friend.

955
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:31,355
Anything I've done, I've done for
the betterment of the universe.

956
01:23:31,38 --> 01:23:38,281
Newsflash, Einstein. Better universe generally don't include
a bunch of octopuses selling meth to guys with cockroach heads.

957
01:23:39,316 --> 01:23:40,504
They do not.

958
01:23:42,891 --> 01:23:46,332
Which is why, as I've
done many times before...

959
01:23:46,606 --> 01:23:48,915
I'm going to have to raze it all,

960
01:23:49,105 --> 01:23:50,535
and start again.

961
01:24:00,137 --> 01:24:03,621
I got 89P13 and
I'm on my way.

962
01:24:03,646 --> 01:24:05,09
We're in possession of the subject.

963
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:32,89
Oh, my God.

964
01:24:43,548 --> 01:24:44,968
I am Groot?

965
01:24:45,073 --> 01:24:46,116
Kill them all.

966
01:24:49,312 --> 01:24:50,647
Stay.

967
01:24:51,779 --> 01:24:53,397
I said stay.

968
01:24:54,693 --> 01:24:57,632
What? Did you want me to leave you
back so that mother could pull at you?

969
01:24:58,481 --> 01:24:59,575
Stay.

970
01:24:59,864 --> 01:25:03,273
What the hell, we're working
for the same boss.

971
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:07,545
Yes, but I need the credit, chum.
To save my entire civilization.

972
01:25:08,307 --> 01:25:11,397
So be a good creepy... thing,

973
01:25:11,609 --> 01:25:12,71
and back off.

974
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:23,384
Oh.

975
01:26:03,68 --> 01:26:05,055
Mother.

976
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,263
Mother!

977
01:26:35,65 --> 01:26:37,232
Mantis, Drax, come in.

978
01:26:37,646 --> 01:26:39,646
Mantis, Drax?

979
01:26:40,365 --> 01:26:43,349
- Uh, hey.
- I need you to bring the ship here, now!

980
01:26:43,374 --> 01:26:46,013
Well, we can't do that exactly, because...

981
01:26:46,665 --> 01:26:47,857
We're not in the ship.

982
01:26:47,882 --> 01:26:49,287
Then where the hell are you?

983
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:19,673
- Nebula, come in.
- Gamora!

984
01:27:19,698 --> 01:27:22,923
Take off now! Get yourself
and Rocket off the planet!

985
01:27:28,137 --> 01:27:29,567
What kind of ship is this?

986
01:27:33,043 --> 01:27:34,614
That's amusing, really.

987
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,34
How stupid are you?

988
01:27:36,365 --> 01:27:38,2
It was so obviously a trap.

989
01:27:38,287 --> 01:27:41,059
It's not a trap, it's a face-off!

990
01:27:41,516 --> 01:27:43,387
Now, kill them all.

991
01:27:49,784 --> 01:27:50,785
Grenade!

992
01:28:29,002 --> 01:28:32,555
I am Groot!

993
01:29:05,736 --> 01:29:07,849
No, no, no, please.

994
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:10,412
*

995
01:29:14,563 --> 01:29:17,162
Thank you, thank you.

996
01:29:17,551 --> 01:29:18,952
That would be premature.

997
01:29:19,073 --> 01:29:20,835
Huh? No, no, no, no!

998
01:29:32,277 --> 01:29:34,277
Quite a novel escape plan.

999
01:29:34,358 --> 01:29:36,925
Jumping headfirst into
an exploding planet.

1000
01:29:41,733 --> 01:29:43,472
You'll kill us both!

1001
01:29:43,497 --> 01:29:45,128
Not both!

1002
01:30:01,01 --> 01:30:02,152
Why are we doing this?

1003
01:30:02,177 --> 01:30:05,192
Quill and Groot are inside!
We have to get them out.

1004
01:30:34,141 --> 01:30:35,281
Groot.

1005
01:30:51,189 --> 01:30:53,679
Whoever's in the cockpit,
activate the brake.

1006
01:30:53,704 --> 01:30:55,672
The steering mechanism is stuck!

1007
01:30:55,697 --> 01:30:57,195
Well, pull harder!

1008
01:31:02,879 --> 01:31:04,448
Let's go!

1009
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:26,712
It's hard to breathe.

1010
01:31:33,602 --> 01:31:35,602
We are entering space.

1011
01:32:02,093 --> 01:32:03,387
Oh, piss off.

1012
01:32:12,456 --> 01:32:15,215
What kind of monster
slaughters a civilization?

1013
01:32:15,664 --> 01:32:17,664
- Where are Mantis and Drax?
- I do not know!

1014
01:32:25,926 --> 01:32:27,506
You're lucky I was able
to knock down that door.

1015
01:32:27,531 --> 01:32:30,412
Rocket and Gamora, are
probably dead because of you!

1016
01:32:30,539 --> 01:32:32,374
- I didn't know.
- Oh, you didn't know?

1017
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:35,701
When are you gonna stop using the
excuse of being some big dumb clown

1018
01:32:35,726 --> 01:32:39,285
for contributing nothing, and the
rest of us having to carry your slack!

1019
01:32:39,31 --> 01:32:42,054
Don't push him! You don't have
the right to push him.

1020
01:32:42,079 --> 01:32:43,917
And you, you're no better.

1021
01:32:43,942 --> 01:32:48,855
The only thing we can count on you for, is when someone
shows weakness, you'll be right there to support it.

1022
01:32:48,879 --> 01:32:50,316
Fine, I don't care.

1023
01:32:50,341 --> 01:32:53,894
I know you need to find fault in everyone
else to make yourself feel okay.

1024
01:32:54,108 --> 01:32:55,26
So find it in me.

1025
01:32:55,286 --> 01:32:56,8
Go to hell, Mant!

1026
01:32:56,825 --> 01:32:58,825
But you don't have
the right to push him!

1027
01:32:59,141 --> 01:33:00,957
It's not his fault he's stupid.

1028
01:33:01,448 --> 01:33:02,448
He's a liability.

1029
01:33:02,474 --> 01:33:06,871
He makes us laugh and he loves
us. How is that a liability?

1030
01:33:07,188 --> 01:33:10,746
All you care about is
intelligence and competence.

1031
01:33:10,771 --> 01:33:12,793
Not sure I appreciate this defense.

1032
01:33:12,817 --> 01:33:14,347
He has sadness...

1033
01:33:14,435 --> 01:33:17,307
But he's the only one of you
who doesn't hate himself.

1034
01:33:17,723 --> 01:33:19,534
I don't care if he's stupid.

1035
01:33:20,26 --> 01:33:21,753
Do you think I'm stupid?

1036
01:33:23,077 --> 01:33:24,159
Yes.

1037
01:33:27,923 --> 01:33:29,144
Forget.

1038
01:33:31,913 --> 01:33:35,086
Hah! You're lucky I was able to knock
down that door with my incredible strength.

1039
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:36,977
Quill?

1040
01:33:37,532 --> 01:33:39,391
Quill, are you there?

1041
01:33:43,475 --> 01:33:45,805
This language isn't in my translator.

1042
01:34:19,817 --> 01:34:20,968
Okay.

1043
01:34:21,221 --> 01:34:23,156
Alright, Rocket. Go.

1044
01:34:40,665 --> 01:34:41,914
Lylla?

1045
01:34:44,565 --> 01:34:46,211
Friend.

1046
01:34:49,007 --> 01:34:50,836
Okay. Okay...

1047
01:34:50,861 --> 01:34:52,219
Okay, here we go.

1048
01:34:55,614 --> 01:34:57,078
This isn't right.

1049
01:34:57,561 --> 01:34:59,813
No, no, no. It's good.
It's gonna work. It's working.

1050
01:34:59,838 --> 01:35:01,242
It needs to be faster.

1051
01:35:03,765 --> 01:35:06,617
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1052
01:35:08,801 --> 01:35:11,43
- Rocket.
- I let you down.

1053
01:35:12,002 --> 01:35:13,5
I got you killed.

1054
01:35:16,146 --> 01:35:17,664
You were right.

1055
01:35:18,195 --> 01:35:20,11
The sky is beautiful.

1056
01:35:20,134 --> 01:35:21,625
And it is forever.

1057
01:35:22,366 --> 01:35:25,289
And I've been flying
with our friends.

1058
01:35:38,627 --> 01:35:40,328
Can I come?

1059
01:35:40,453 --> 01:35:41,531
Yes.

1060
01:35:51,259 --> 01:35:52,446
No, no, no, no.

1061
01:35:52,742 --> 01:35:53,75
No!

1062
01:35:55,673 --> 01:35:57,321
- Come on!
- Quill.

1063
01:36:00,149 --> 01:36:01,578
No!

1064
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:03,673
No!

1065
01:36:06,174 --> 01:36:07,633
- Quill...
- No!

1066
01:36:08,588 --> 01:36:10,796
- I'm not gonna lose him.
- He is gone.

1067
01:36:10,822 --> 01:36:13,796
I'm not letting him go!

1068
01:36:29,739 --> 01:36:30,977
But not yet.

1069
01:36:32,244 --> 01:36:34,649
You still have a purpose here.

1070
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:36,243
A purpose for what?

1071
01:36:37,01 --> 01:36:38,61
They made us for nothing!

1072
01:36:38,744 --> 01:36:41,727
Just a bunch of experiments
to be thrown away!

1073
01:36:42,344 --> 01:36:44,344
There are the hands that made us...

1074
01:36:44,493 --> 01:36:47,266
and then there are the
hands that guide the hands.

1075
01:36:54,647 --> 01:36:56,647
My beloved raccoon...

1076
01:36:57,444 --> 01:37:01,436
This story has been yours
all along. You just didn't know it.

1077
01:37:05,274 --> 01:37:06,526
I'm not a raccoon.

1078
01:37:14,268 --> 01:37:15,665
The pass key's coming through!

1079
01:37:53,733 --> 01:37:55,01
Where's Nebula?

1080
01:38:01,052 --> 01:38:02,707
She, she's, uh....

1081
01:38:03,579 --> 01:38:05,481
'Cause her call's on
the comm behind you.

1082
01:38:11,837 --> 01:38:13,406
- What... Nebula?
- Where are you?

1083
01:38:13,43 --> 01:38:15,865
- Oh, thank God!
- We're here to get you out of here.

1084
01:38:16,016 --> 01:38:17,593
- Out of where?
- The High Evolutionary's ship!

1085
01:38:17,619 --> 01:38:18,811
No, I got off the ship.

1086
01:38:19,168 --> 01:38:20,703
- You what?
- Wait, where are you?

1087
01:38:20,751 --> 01:38:21,906
On the ship!

1088
01:38:21,93 --> 01:38:23,461
- On the ship?!
- I didn't lie.

1089
01:38:23,485 --> 01:38:26,351
- Why are you on the ship?
- To save you, obviously!

1090
01:38:26,376 --> 01:38:30,694
No, I told you to go back. You gotta know by now I
always figure out a clever way to get out of a fix!

1091
01:38:30,811 --> 01:38:32,811
- Tell him I said hi.
- Really?

1092
01:38:32,916 --> 01:38:34,476
Tell him we're coming to save him.

1093
01:38:34,501 --> 01:38:37,703
Pay attention or play with
the kids. One or the other.

1094
01:38:37,728 --> 01:38:40,234
- Play with the kids?
- How did you get out?

1095
01:38:40,259 --> 01:38:42,672
- That's not really important...
- I am Groot.

1096
01:38:42,8 --> 01:38:47,819
Jumping a 1000 feet to your death without a
parachute is a clever way of getting out of a fix?

1097
01:38:48,363 --> 01:38:50,476
You're only just making up
stuff that he's saying, right?

1098
01:38:50,742 --> 01:38:53,164
The important thing
is we're all okay.

1099
01:38:56,763 --> 01:38:57,781
Rocket?

1100
01:38:58,744 --> 01:39:01,975
Yes, he's here and he's okay.

1101
01:39:07,706 --> 01:39:11,694
Rocket, we love you very much
and we're happy you're alive.

1102
01:39:12,441 --> 01:39:14,101
Well that makes you idiots, then.

1103
01:39:14,141 --> 01:39:16,141
He's right about that.

1104
01:39:17,58 --> 01:39:18,968
Back in your cages!

1105
01:39:23,103 --> 01:39:24,328
Nebula?

1106
01:39:25,348 --> 01:39:26,843
Nebula, come in.

1107
01:39:32,455 --> 01:39:35,703
So, you'd like to joust, would you?

1108
01:39:37,646 --> 01:39:39,797
Go to hell, you sick
son of a bitch.

1109
01:39:39,948 --> 01:39:41,5
You killed all of those people.

1110
01:39:41,525 --> 01:39:43,211
As I will your friends.

1111
01:39:43,9 --> 01:39:45,9
I'm sending you the coordinates.

1112
01:39:46,149 --> 01:39:49,647
They will die unless you
bring me what is mine!

1113
01:39:49,673 --> 01:39:57,945
Screw you, you stretch-faced, Robocop looking,
Skeletor wannabe, purple-nurple, piece of---

1114
01:40:00,783 --> 01:40:01,859
He hung up.

1115
01:40:04,725 --> 01:40:05,819
You think?

1116
01:40:09,079 --> 01:40:10,866
1966...

1117
01:40:10,991 --> 01:40:13,186
The Soviets put me on a rocket

1118
01:40:13,21 --> 01:40:18,843
knowing full well I never to return
and I will die in a fiery ball of death.

1119
01:40:18,947 --> 01:40:21,914
The one thing even Soviets never do,

1120
01:40:21,938 --> 01:40:24,055
is call me "bad dog."

1121
01:40:24,099 --> 01:40:26,546
Oh, my God, just let it go.

1122
01:40:26,572 --> 01:40:29,414
Kraglin, please, just take it back.

1123
01:40:29,438 --> 01:40:30,819
This is killing us.

1124
01:40:30,845 --> 01:40:35,156
I can't take it back if she
is, in fact, a bad dog.

1125
01:40:35,892 --> 01:40:38,414
It never stops hurting.

1126
01:40:39,093 --> 01:40:42,016
- Kraglin.
- Oh, hey, Pete.

1127
01:40:42,123 --> 01:40:44,351
We need to save
Nebula, Mantis and Drax,

1128
01:40:44,376 --> 01:40:45,937
and we need your help.

1129
01:40:45,962 --> 01:40:47,125
Me?

1130
01:40:50,647 --> 01:40:52,647
You're the one who
lost him, you twit!

1131
01:40:52,672 --> 01:40:54,555
The hellspawn heard it, sire.

1132
01:40:54,58 --> 01:40:57,422
- But...
- But, but, but, but, but!

1133
01:40:59,027 --> 01:41:00,953
That rancid word.

1134
01:41:03,899 --> 01:41:06,218
I'm merely wondering
whether it might be wiser,

1135
01:41:06,244 --> 01:41:09,772
to go directly to the new colony and
not engage in unnecessary conflict.

1136
01:41:09,798 --> 01:41:13,64
They can rewire a carbonetrix
core in under two minutes.

1137
01:41:13,665 --> 01:41:15,311
But what is that, Vim?

1138
01:41:16,073 --> 01:41:18,961
- Rote memorization.
- Rote memorization!

1139
01:41:19,579 --> 01:41:24,569
In hundreds of years of our creations,
only one has known true invention.

1140
01:41:24,936 --> 01:41:25,968
One.

1141
01:41:27,667 --> 01:41:29,667
Putrid in every other way,

1142
01:41:29,753 --> 01:41:32,616
but 89P13 had that.

1143
01:41:35,437 --> 01:41:36,664
Yes, sire.

1144
01:41:37,49 --> 01:41:40,265
A populace unable to think,

1145
01:41:40,334 --> 01:41:42,771
what hasn't yet been thought, will die.

1146
01:41:42,853 --> 01:41:46,922
And why we need 89P13's brain

1147
01:41:46,947 --> 01:41:50,522
so we can transfer that
trait into these creatures

1148
01:41:50,56 --> 01:41:52,655
before we go to the new colony.

1149
01:41:52,68 --> 01:41:54,507
Nothing else matters.

1150
01:42:14,736 --> 01:42:16,393
How did they get down here?

1151
01:42:19,239 --> 01:42:21,768
Peter will be trying to
get to the spaceport.

1152
01:42:21,992 --> 01:42:23,768
He doesn't know about the children.

1153
01:42:24,078 --> 01:42:25,206
You!

1154
01:42:26,221 --> 01:42:31,081
We need you to let all the other children onboard
know to stay away from the starboard walls!

1155
01:42:33,615 --> 01:42:36,135
They know three freaking words
and two of them are joob.

1156
01:42:37,369 --> 01:42:39,369
No! Listen to me.

1157
01:42:40,009 --> 01:42:42,409
You need to talk
to the other children.

1158
01:42:42,506 --> 01:42:45,26
All of them here, and tell them,

1159
01:42:45,285 --> 01:42:47,285
to stay away, from the freakin'----

1160
01:42:47,31 --> 01:42:48,948
What the hell are you
doing, Mantis?

1161
01:42:48,973 --> 01:42:51,706
Explaining it, dickhead!

1162
01:43:02,588 --> 01:43:03,853
You're scaring them.

1163
01:43:10,024 --> 01:43:11,384
Hello, dumb idiots.

1164
01:43:15,878 --> 01:43:17,878
I had a little girl like you.

1165
01:43:17,903 --> 01:43:19,276
You know what she used to like?

1166
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:22,432
She liked when I
made monkey noises.

1167
01:43:32,869 --> 01:43:34,245
How is that a monkey?

1168
01:43:35,155 --> 01:43:36,354
Beats me.

1169
01:44:17,878 --> 01:44:20,204
They're gonna tell the other kids to stay
away from the starboard wall.

1170
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:23,352
Why didn't you tell us you knew
their language this whole time?

1171
01:44:23,479 --> 01:44:24,866
Why didn't you ask?

1172
01:44:27,317 --> 01:44:29,317
This could be futile, Quill.

1173
01:44:29,542 --> 01:44:30,985
He's too powerful.

1174
01:44:31,086 --> 01:44:32,719
Well then, I guess we'll die trying.

1175
01:44:33,028 --> 01:44:35,321
What is dying trying gonna accomplish?

1176
01:44:35,626 --> 01:44:37,329
Or we can just give
him the badger.

1177
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:39,766
Our thing, is dying trying.

1178
01:44:39,921 --> 01:44:41,274
I am Groot.

1179
01:44:41,299 --> 01:44:43,299
I know who you are already!

1180
01:44:43,324 --> 01:44:45,563
Feel free to stay
behind in the cargo area.

1181
01:44:45,727 --> 01:44:48,188
I'm not leaving my
sister with that jackass.

1182
01:44:48,664 --> 01:44:49,923
This you?

1183
01:44:50,229 --> 01:44:51,688
Fell out of your bag.

1184
01:44:54,113 --> 01:44:55,469
Let's do this.

1185
01:45:31,893 --> 01:45:33,306
Wait...

1186
01:45:35,099 --> 01:45:36,376
Wait...

1187
01:45:42,183 --> 01:45:44,275
You almost have to
admire their pluck.

1188
01:45:45,482 --> 01:45:46,522
Sire.

1189
01:45:57,525 --> 01:45:59,525
Howdy there, you freakin' creep.

1190
01:46:04,046 --> 01:46:05,87
- Back up!
- Yes, sire.

1191
01:46:08,235 --> 01:46:09,588
You're on, Steemie.

1192
01:46:10,402 --> 01:46:12,307
First barrel.

1193
01:46:13,399 --> 01:46:15,049
Second barrel.

1194
01:46:15,701 --> 01:46:17,269
Third barrel.

1195
01:46:17,293 --> 01:46:18,503
Fourth barrel.

1196
01:46:26,986 --> 01:46:28,986
Hard starboard.

1197
01:46:29,012 --> 01:46:30,417
Hard starboard.

1198
01:46:35,847 --> 01:46:37,386
And, fire!

1199
01:46:45,89 --> 01:46:47,351
They've breached the spaceport.

1200
01:46:47,376 --> 01:46:49,984
One of them holds subject 89P13.

1201
01:46:50,009 --> 01:46:51,788
Release the hellspawn, all of them.

1202
01:46:51,813 --> 01:46:54,616
Sire, the hellspawn were created
solely to defend the new colony.

1203
01:46:54,641 --> 01:46:56,015
Do it now!

1204
01:46:56,04 --> 01:46:57,96
Get me 89P13,

1205
01:46:58,0 --> 01:47:01,423
and kill everyone in the
head of that dead god!

1206
01:47:39,463 --> 01:47:42,8
Spaceport wide open, Cap'n, but
that armaments was all we had.

1207
01:47:42,825 --> 01:47:45,01
Rocket, Groot, go, go!

1208
01:47:45,036 --> 01:47:46,355
Get inside that spaceport.

1209
01:48:00,203 --> 01:48:01,495
What the hell?

1210
01:48:15,759 --> 01:48:17,367
Aww, come on!

1211
01:48:47,266 --> 01:48:49,852
Kraglin, we have been infiltrated!

1212
01:48:52,003 --> 01:48:53,274
Open the pit.

1213
01:48:53,299 --> 01:48:55,891
Sire, our bargaining
power will be gone.

1214
01:49:21,208 --> 01:49:22,433
Abilisks!

1215
01:49:29,622 --> 01:49:31,13
Good God...

1216
01:49:37,456 --> 01:49:38,716
This way!

1217
01:50:44,705 --> 01:50:47,001
One more step and
this weird thing gets it!

1218
01:50:47,027 --> 01:50:48,315
Don't be rash.

1219
01:51:06,805 --> 01:51:08,125
What were you programming?

1220
01:51:08,15 --> 01:51:09,5
Self-destruction code.

1221
01:51:27,366 --> 01:51:28,554
What are you doing?

1222
01:51:31,903 --> 01:51:33,054
It's okay.

1223
01:51:33,079 --> 01:51:34,569
Mantis, stop.

1224
01:51:36,576 --> 01:51:39,162
They eat batteries, not people.

1225
01:51:40,766 --> 01:51:44,249
Maybe they're just scared of
what we are gonna do to them.

1226
01:51:50,842 --> 01:51:52,554
We're not gonna hurt you.

1227
01:51:55,652 --> 01:51:57,652
Everything is going to be okay.

1228
01:52:53,463 --> 01:52:55,463
Use your heart, boy.

1229
01:53:45,826 --> 01:53:47,391
A dog?

1230
01:53:47,416 --> 01:53:48,437
Yeah.

1231
01:53:56,925 --> 01:53:58,602
She's a good dog.

1232
01:54:03,173 --> 01:54:05,628
I knew you believe
I'm good dog.

1233
01:54:05,652 --> 01:54:07,652
Alright, alright,
alright. Get off me.

1234
01:54:11,003 --> 01:54:14,182
Sire, we must retreat.
The ship is going down.

1235
01:54:14,206 --> 01:54:16,096
The spaceport has intruders.

1236
01:54:16,121 --> 01:54:18,807
Go, see if one of them is 89P13.

1237
01:54:18,831 --> 01:54:21,12
Sire, you have an irrational
obsession with this animal.

1238
01:54:21,145 --> 01:54:22,736
You must stop
for God's sake---

1239
01:54:22,762 --> 01:54:26,783
There is no god!
That's why I stepped in!

1240
01:54:55,114 --> 01:54:59,638
Controller, I am taking
command of the Arete.

1241
01:54:59,809 --> 01:55:04,069
Disengage all damaged
sectors of the ship.

1242
01:55:04,688 --> 01:55:06,179
And retreat...

1243
01:55:31,489 --> 01:55:32,708
Attention,

1244
01:55:32,732 --> 01:55:34,083
all personnel...

1245
01:55:34,983 --> 01:55:38,26
Intruders have boarded the ship.

1246
01:55:38,917 --> 01:55:42,13
Head to the starboard spaceport.

1247
01:55:43,663 --> 01:55:46,292
Bring me 89P13.

1248
01:55:47,485 --> 01:55:49,232
And kill the rest.

1249
01:55:58,507 --> 01:56:01,576
We go in there, we get
Mantis, Nebula and Drax.

1250
01:56:01,728 --> 01:56:04,673
We move in, we get
them, and get out.

1251
01:56:24,066 --> 01:56:25,634
Did that look cool?

1252
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:27,168
Okay.

1253
01:56:27,194 --> 01:56:29,817
New gameplan. We get
the hell outta here now.

1254
01:56:30,09 --> 01:56:31,771
There are thousands of
creatures on this ship.

1255
01:56:31,796 --> 01:56:34,719
- Many of them are children.
- We need to be good joob-joob.

1256
01:56:34,885 --> 01:56:37,268
- Huh?
- It means friends.

1257
01:56:38,227 --> 01:56:41,118
If we want to live,
we have to leave now.

1258
01:56:41,143 --> 01:56:43,51
This whole rig is gonna
go down any second.

1259
01:56:43,672 --> 01:56:46,104
They will all die, if
we don't help them.

1260
01:56:53,152 --> 01:56:54,733
I'm done runnin'.

1261
01:59:58,044 --> 01:59:59,607
There's a big hole
up in the deck.

1262
01:59:59,632 --> 02:00:02,828
If we can connect that to Knowhere,
we can lead the survivors to safety.

1263
02:00:03,061 --> 02:00:04,741
Nebs and me
will pilot the ship.

1264
02:00:04,766 --> 02:00:07,078
You guys save all
the higher life forms.

1265
02:00:17,378 --> 02:00:18,415
Hello, moron.

1266
02:00:21,521 --> 02:00:22,542
Come on!

1267
02:00:24,432 --> 02:00:25,994
Follow me, come on!

1268
02:00:27,295 --> 02:00:28,466
Come on!

1269
02:00:29,471 --> 02:00:30,831
Go, go, go!

1270
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,771
I am Groot.

1271
02:00:51,699 --> 02:00:53,356
Um, this way to...

1272
02:00:53,872 --> 02:00:55,053
Thank you.

1273
02:00:55,078 --> 02:00:56,616
Yes, you're welcome.

1274
02:00:56,641 --> 02:00:59,485
I was screaming at something
scary behind you. Not you.

1275
02:00:59,524 --> 02:01:01,239
You look really cool.

1276
02:01:06,637 --> 02:01:08,889
Kill me if you want, but then
good luck getting out of here.

1277
02:01:13,069 --> 02:01:15,271
Let him go. That guy's
our only chance.

1278
02:01:15,325 --> 02:01:19,277
I got a space big enough to get through. I gotta
find out if I can change it to a permeable shield.

1279
02:01:25,846 --> 02:01:29,32
I can't fly this freakin' thing. The
controls are all screwed.

1280
02:01:29,371 --> 02:01:30,464
I'll do it.

1281
02:01:30,627 --> 02:01:33,227
Go help the others. Wait,
give me your comm.

1282
02:01:41,084 --> 02:01:43,845
Kraglin, I'll pilot
from this side.

1283
02:01:44,927 --> 02:01:47,083
Nebula, back in action.

1284
02:02:13,817 --> 02:02:15,28
Come on, come on, come on!

1285
02:02:15,494 --> 02:02:17,744
Go, go!
Go, go, go!

1286
02:02:19,729 --> 02:02:21,628
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

1287
02:02:22,165 --> 02:02:23,17
Are those kids?

1288
02:02:40,493 --> 02:02:42,001
Okay, Cosmo, stitch it up.

1289
02:02:42,025 --> 02:02:44,714
It needs to be airtight for
the kids to make it across!

1290
02:02:44,739 --> 02:02:46,269
Locking up, captain.

1291
02:02:54,98 --> 02:02:56,543
Go, now, go.

1292
02:03:01,134 --> 02:03:02,701
One by one.
One by one.

1293
02:03:10,704 --> 02:03:12,807
Landing in, and headed down.

1294
02:03:19,427 --> 02:03:20,776
This way, this way.

1295
02:03:24,878 --> 02:03:25,932
Why?

1296
02:03:27,604 --> 02:03:30,313
Why are you doing this?
I tried to kill you.

1297
02:03:31,059 --> 02:03:33,333
I am Groot.

1298
02:03:34,015 --> 02:03:37,416
He says everyone
deserves a second chance.

1299
02:03:48,394 --> 02:03:50,853
You are so strong.

1300
02:03:54,113 --> 02:03:56,57
Come on! Why
are you so slow?

1301
02:03:58,596 --> 02:03:59,864
Where is Rocket?

1302
02:06:29,477 --> 02:06:30,57
No!

1303
02:06:31,755 --> 02:06:33,873
You thought you could escape me?

1304
02:06:34,553 --> 02:06:35,606
No!

1305
02:06:37,836 --> 02:06:41,835
You think you have some worth in
and of yourself without me?

1306
02:06:41,866 --> 02:06:43,106
No!

1307
02:06:44,25 --> 02:06:46,25
You are an abomination!

1308
02:06:46,285 --> 02:06:49,307
Nothing more than a step, on my path!

1309
02:06:49,332 --> 02:06:52,144
You freakish little monster!

1310
02:06:52,17 --> 02:06:54,843
How dare you think you are more?

1311
02:06:55,03 --> 02:06:58,998
8-9-P-1-3!

1312
02:07:02,292 --> 02:07:06,54
The name's Rocket.
Rocket Raccoon.

1313
02:07:46,988 --> 02:07:48,354
His face came off.

1314
02:07:48,789 --> 02:07:49,832
It's a mask.

1315
02:07:51,537 --> 02:07:53,537
Look what you did to me.

1316
02:07:54,589 --> 02:07:55,647
For what?

1317
02:07:56,265 --> 02:07:58,092
All I wanted to do...

1318
02:07:58,694 --> 02:08:01,862
was to make things perfect.

1319
02:08:02,778 --> 02:08:05,173
You didn't want to
make things perfect.

1320
02:08:05,353 --> 02:08:07,927
You just hated things
the way they are.

1321
02:08:08,144 --> 02:08:09,149
Kill him.

1322
02:08:15,82 --> 02:08:16,854
Why?

1323
02:08:17,783 --> 02:08:20,647
Because I'm a freakin'
Guardian of the Galaxy.

1324
02:08:21,712 --> 02:08:23,972
We have to get
out of here, now.

1325
02:08:24,02 --> 02:08:25,164
We have to save them

1326
02:08:25,189 --> 02:08:26,607
We've got all the kids on board.

1327
02:08:26,632 --> 02:08:29,781
No, Pete. The
rest of them.

1328
02:08:35,825 --> 02:08:37,595
Come on! Come on, move.

1329
02:08:38,501 --> 02:08:39,527
Move it.

1330
02:08:39,653 --> 02:08:40,685
Whoa.

1331
02:08:46,583 --> 02:08:47,595
Come on.

1332
02:08:48,175 --> 02:08:49,726
Come on, come on.

1333
02:08:52,535 --> 02:08:55,344
I thought we were limiting ourselves
to the higher life forms.

1334
02:08:56,047 --> 02:08:57,055
Me, too.

1335
02:09:05,17 --> 02:09:07,341
Go babies. Go, babies.

1336
02:09:07,495 --> 02:09:09,131
Go!

1337
02:09:09,252 --> 02:09:11,496
I cannot hold... much...

1338
02:09:32,147 --> 02:09:33,377
Quill!

1339
02:09:33,402 --> 02:09:34,414
Hurry!

1340
02:10:17,079 --> 02:10:20,287
Peter!

1341
02:11:27,486 --> 02:11:28,558
Peter.

1342
02:11:33,868 --> 02:11:36,663
Did that...

1343
02:11:37,754 --> 02:11:38,95
... look cool?

1344
02:11:42,433 --> 02:11:43,509
Come on.

1345
02:11:55,665 --> 02:11:56,965
Cosmo.

1346
02:11:57,305 --> 02:11:58,534
I'm okay.

1347
02:12:36,127 --> 02:12:37,377
I am Groot.

1348
02:12:38,212 --> 02:12:40,893
Thanks, just tell them
I'm gonna be right...

1349
02:12:46,226 --> 02:12:47,47
I am Groot.

1350
02:12:49,379 --> 02:12:52,534
Yeah. It's good working
with you too.

1351
02:12:59,842 --> 02:13:02,661
Hey Gamora, are you ready?

1352
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:04,152
Yeah.

1353
02:13:10,411 --> 02:13:12,411
You know I'm still not
who you want me to be.

1354
02:13:14,127 --> 02:13:15,146
I know.

1355
02:13:16,459 --> 02:13:18,287
But who you are ain't so bad.

1356
02:13:38,631 --> 02:13:39,991
I bet we were fun.

1357
02:13:45,51 --> 02:13:47,257
Like you wouldn't believe.

1358
02:13:54,046 --> 02:13:55,111
All right.

1359
02:14:08,627 --> 02:14:10,139
Are you okay?

1360
02:14:11,997 --> 02:14:13,997
I think I need to
talk to everybody.

1361
02:14:16,352 --> 02:14:18,352
So, you're gonna leave?

1362
02:14:20,218 --> 02:14:24,343
My mother died in front of me when I was 8
years old and I have been running ever since.

1363
02:14:25,616 --> 02:14:27,192
I'm gonna need to take some time.

1364
02:14:30,031 --> 02:14:31,155
Learn how to swim.

1365
02:14:34,114 --> 02:14:35,246
I as well.

1366
02:14:39,649 --> 02:14:41,119
I love you all.

1367
02:14:41,541 --> 02:14:42,625
I do.

1368
02:14:46,62 --> 02:14:50,175
But my whole life, I did
whatever Ego wanted.

1369
02:14:50,3 --> 02:14:52,881
And then I did whatever
the Guardians wanted.

1370
02:14:53,915 --> 02:14:57,22
I need to go out and
discover what I want.

1371
02:14:57,373 --> 02:14:59,5
- I will come with you.
- No Drax.

1372
02:14:59,726 --> 02:15:00,969
That's the whole point.

1373
02:15:00,995 --> 02:15:02,483
But you need someone to protect you.

1374
02:15:02,507 --> 02:15:04,259
- I don't.
- Not in a bad way.

1375
02:15:04,471 --> 02:15:06,076
Just because of your
incredible weakness.

1376
02:15:06,102 --> 02:15:07,979
Oh, my God, you're so frustrating.

1377
02:15:08,004 --> 02:15:10,884
Drax, I need you here.

1378
02:15:11,557 --> 02:15:13,348
We're building a new society.

1379
02:15:13,619 --> 02:15:16,085
I need all the support I can get
for those children out there.

1380
02:15:17,448 --> 02:15:20,31
Today, I saw who you are.

1381
02:15:21,317 --> 02:15:23,128
You weren't born
to be a destroyer.

1382
02:15:25,034 --> 02:15:26,503
You were born
to be a dad.

1383
02:15:31,139 --> 02:15:32,966
So you'll lead the Guardians then?

1384
02:15:33,536 --> 02:15:34,578
No.

1385
02:15:35,078 --> 02:15:36,425
I'm going to lead the city.

1386
02:15:37,342 --> 02:15:38,989
Make it the type of
home I never had.

1387
02:15:41,887 --> 02:15:43,306
So that's it?

1388
02:15:44,726 --> 02:15:46,07
The group's over?

1389
02:15:46,583 --> 02:15:47,646
No.

1390
02:15:48,26 --> 02:15:50,324
The galaxy still
needs its guardians.

1391
02:15:51,41 --> 02:15:54,123
And you, will make a better
leader than I ever was...

1392
02:15:55,278 --> 02:15:56,382
Captain.

1393
02:16:16,497 --> 02:16:18,264
I love you, guys.

1394
02:18:31,223 --> 02:18:32,703
Welcome home.

1395
02:19:20,953 --> 02:19:23,078
I think I might
be at the wrong...

1396
02:19:24,27 --> 02:19:25,967
I'm looking for Jason Quill?

1397
02:19:25,991 --> 02:19:28,275
Yes. Come in.

1398
02:19:47,154 --> 02:19:48,326
Pete.

1399
02:20:00,072 --> 02:20:01,406

02:22:04,317 --> 02:22:06,719
Okay, how about your
favorite musical act?

1406
02:22:07,004 --> 02:22:08,126
Phyla, you first.

1407
02:22:09,728 --> 02:22:12,551
Britney Spears and Korn.

1408
02:22:12,977 --> 02:22:15,504
- Good choices.
- I gotta go with the man.

1409
02:22:15,698 --> 02:22:16,897
Garth Brooks.

1410
02:22:16,967 --> 02:22:19,966
The Carpenters did not
have a single bad song.

1411
02:22:20,223 --> 02:22:21,492
Adrian Belew.

1412
02:22:21,706 --> 02:22:24,895
Both solo, and his work
with King Crimson.

1413
02:22:25,859 --> 02:22:27,054
What about you, captain?

1414
02:22:27,128 --> 02:22:29,128
Oh, this one's kinda special.

1415
02:22:29,83 --> 02:22:32,701
♪ come and get your love ♪

1416
02:22:46,944 --> 02:22:48,408
Guess they're here.

1417
02:22:48,76 --> 02:22:49,779
Well...

1418
02:22:50,652 --> 02:22:54,004
I can handle this by my lonesome
if you all wanna chill.

1419
02:22:54,614 --> 02:22:57,676
Nah, nah, it'll go fast if
we all do it together.

1420
02:22:58,165 --> 02:22:59,373
Groot, wake up.

1421
02:23:10,081 --> 02:23:12,081
Does anyone feel a
little sad for them?

1422
02:23:12,144 --> 02:23:15,67
Yeah, sure. But these townsfolk
can't protect themselves.

1423
02:23:16,02 --> 02:23:17,473
On your word, Captain.

1424
02:23:27,774 --> 02:23:29,015
Word.

1425
02:29:54,696 --> 02:29:58,977
If she needs help mowing the lawn, I'll
do it but it kinda feel like her son's job.

1426
02:29:59,257 --> 02:30:01,578
Is she gonna sit on the
porch and watch me do it?

1427
02:30:01,655 --> 02:30:05,39
Like, a 45 year old man,
quietly mowing his lawn...

1428
02:30:05,462 --> 02:30:06,938
It just feels weird.

1429
02:30:06,977 --> 02:30:08,78
Don't get me started.

1430
02:30:10,21 --> 02:30:11,364
All right?
